      "## The Start\n\nAlthough this styoryline is not fiction at all, it's anyway about the future and\nit's dystopian, as you could imagine.\n\nWhat do we have to do to actually have a future? How can we save our planet? Do\nwe have to re-invent the world? Is it a re-birth, the second incarnation of\nworld, **World 2**, so to say? Or is it actually not that complicated at all?\n\nSo it's all about the Seldon'esque crisis we're facing at the moment, **the\nclimate catastrophe**. I'd especially like to spread into three different\nstreams:\n\n- **Transport**: Even besides its damage potential to the world climate (and\n  this includes traditional cars and EVs), owning and driving so many cars harms\n  us in many other ways. So it's worth a look on its own.\n\n- **Diet and agriculture**: Food and food production are one of the big reasons\n  for the climate crisis. Everyone knows that, almost nobody accepts it, because\n  it's also the hardest to give up.\n\n- **Energy production**: Did I assume it might be simple? Not really. This is\n  yet another topic with hundreds of side effects. We wage wars and fraternize\n  with despots to get resources for energy production. And we're ahead of\n  another round of exploitation on the African continent.\n\n## Energy\n\nFor [transport](/storylines/traffic) and [agriculture](/storylines/vegan), I\nhave created separate articles. The pure basics of energy production,\nconsumption and management is the part that this article will focus on. So let's\ncrunch some numbers.\n\nEnergy, on the one hand, is by far the biggest driver of the climate crisis. On\nthe other hand, the region of Central Europe faces another crisis fired by heat\nand drought and by the war in Ukraine and our dependency on Russian gas and oil.\n\nOur energy demand spreads into four more or less distinct sectors:\n\n- electricity (43%)\n- industrial consumption (24%)\n- traffic (21%)\n- heating (12%)\n\nMore detailed numbers with sources will follow. The whole climate crisis is much\nmore complex than only turning energy management into its green alternatives. It\nentails other more efficient greenhouse gases than CO₂, deals with deforestation\nand tipping points.\n\nThe creation of this article in the form of a series of postings spread over\nhalf a year. During this time, I had the feeling that the headlines around the\nclimate complex were oveertaking each other. War, pipelines, natural\ncatastrophes, political changes, protests, science reports - the topics piled up\nalmost on an hourly basis.\n\n## The Problem Chain\n\nEven if you touch the surface of those building blocks, you already see that any\nof these fields is utterly complex and never black and white. So before I go\ninto more detail on some of them, let's go back to the problem itself.\n\nEarth thankfully has a greenhouse effect. It would be a\n[cold dead place](https://youtu.be/oLddYrmClQw) of -18°C if it wasn't there.\nThis effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere that are transparent in visual\nlight and opaque in infrared light. The gases with the strongest effects are\nwater vapour (with short term effects) and CO₂ (with complex long-term\nlifecycles).\n\nWe have increased the amount of CO₂ dramatically in the last 100 years - from\n320 to 420 ppm (by 30%) in the last 60 years alone. We have seen that the Earth\nis significantly heating up. The CO₂ pollution is caused by burning fossil\nfuels - like coal (C) or gas (CH<sub>4</sub>).\n\nWe use the energy coming from there for global wealth, so we can't just stop it\nwithout losing this wealth.\n\n## Dimensions\n\nA problem that I have with the climate catastrophe lies in the magnitudes of\nnumbers. When someone says \"this emits 5 kg of CO₂ equivalent\", what does that\nmean? It's totally abstract. And that might be the reason why we don't care in a\nway we should.\n\nSo I think, we should make it more concrete and comparable. When the\n[IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/), the main organisation that tracks climate change,\nreleased their first reports, they came up with a budget that we have left if we\nwant to stay below the 1.5°C. It's **420 billion tons**. This is the amount we\ncan emit until the wold heats up by 1.5 degrees. We want to spread this budget\nuntil 2050.\n\nThat was the catchy and easy to remember claim on the Paris climate agreement\n(closed on December 12th, 2015). **1.5 degrees until 2050**. This also means\nzero - carbon neutral - after 2050.\n\nDivided by 30 and the average expected population of 8,73 billion people, this\nmakes 1,6 tons per year for every one of us. This is my new reference.",

In this scenario of\nthirty years from 2020 to 2050, the overall budget is already used up by 2026\nfor Europeans. It even is about to exceeded already right now for Americans. For\nme, this fact was mindblowing as it showed that we must act now, not just\nin 2030. As a side note, it might be worth mentioning, that China is the only\ncandidate in this list, who's emissions are rising.\n\nTo get used to this metric, let's do some more comparisons.",

      "Source:\n[Umweltbundesamt](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/energie/energiebedingte-emissionen#energiebedingte-kohlendioxid-emissionen-durch-stromerzeugung)\n\nYou see that coal has a huge impact on our emissions, which is completely out of\nproportion compared the the energy it is producing.\n\nThe primary energy consumption in 2020 was 143 GJ/Person\\*a. The coal power\nplant Niederaußem contributed about 0,7% to that energy but it uses up 22,2% of\nour annual CO₂ Budget.\n\nIn comparison, an average gas turbine emits 670 g/kWh. In Germany, we consume 65\nTWh/a through gas, which is 12,6%. The whole gas sector uses up 32,7% of our\nbudget.\n\nGermany is worldwide number one in lignite mining - in absolute numbers, not per\ncapita - 10% more than number two, China. A part of it is also exported and\nconsumed by people outside Germany.\n\n**This impressively shows that we have a huge structural problem that can't be\nsolved by individuals that take care of their footprints. This is a topic for\npoliticians.**\n\nLet's look at another example:",

      },
      "Sources:\n\n- [Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/fix/) has a good calculator for\n  flight emissions. You can also tweak the values and try business instead of\n  economy class.\n- It was hard to find details on private jet emissions. There is no calculator\n  for that, but I found an\n  [article on tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr/privatjets-treibhausgase-klima-101.html)\n\nSo much for the exercise to get into those numbers. I will surely reuse the\ncalculator on some other pages in the future. One last comparison to round up\nthis section:\n\nOur nearest CO₂ sink, the German forest absorbs **46,4%** of our budget.\n\n## How Much Do We Have to Save?\n\nThe budget is gone by 2050 or earlier when we continue to live as we're doing\nnow. At that point, we are not supposed to emit anything anymore. What is left\nis what the trees, moors and oceans absorb.\n\nNumbers say that about 1,9 Gt go into vegetation and 2,9 Gt are absorbed by the\noceans. That's 4,8 Gt or 34% of our current budget from a worldwide perspective.\nSo our simple task is to reduce our emissions from 539% to 34%.\n\nThe problem seems to be approached ved in three steps:\n\n- **Electrification**: The main energy source is supposed to be electricity\n  (e.g. electric cars for transport or heat pumps for heating your living room).\n  This step decouples the energy creation from the energy consumption and gives\n  our economy a lot of flexibility to regulate itself. Exception: the heavy\n  industry will need green hydrogen for their high energy density demand.\n- **Green Electricity**: When all power comes from electricity, this must of\n  course turn carbon neutral. Coal and gas must be replaced by wind, solar,\n  biomass and water. This branch of work packages has also already been\n  started - so both can and have to happen at the same time. We have no time to\n  lose.\n- **Saving Energy**: Who would have guessed that infinite growth is not\n  sustainable? But there's also good news. Electric cars for example are much\n  more efficient than combustion engines. But this is not enough. All processes\n  that we invented have to be revisited and optimized. Does this mean, everyone\n  of us has to sacrifice comfort? No. Many things can be more easily made\n  efficient on a principle level rather than the consumer level. We just have to\n  want it and facilitate it through a suitable political environment.\n\n## Heating\n\nAnother scenario: An average person needs 47,7 m² of living space in Germany. A\n20-year-old house has an average standard of 75 kWh/m²a. If you use gas, this\nequals an emission of 2,3 t/a or almost 150% of the budget. Gigantic. If you\nlive in a passive house, you can reduce that to 30%.\n\nWe seem to have usable solutions for electricity and transport, as it seems. But\nthis third sector, heating our living rooms, seems to be the biggest challenge\nfor carbon neutrality. There are millions of buildings with a lot of inefficient\nbuilt-in technology. So the problem is highly decentral. At the moment, the\nshare of energy sources is\n\n- 41 % gas\n- 17% oil\n- 18% electricity\n- 8% district heating\n- 15% renewable energy\n\nThis contains about 70% of fossil energy sources. The renewable part mainly\ncomes from wood, which also doesn't scale well and also has unwanted short-term\nemissions. So the structural problem is immense and the costs will have to be\npaid by the owners of the buildings.\n\nThere are alternatives. Geothermal heat pumps will have to be introduced\nwherever possible, heat exchangers must become standard and controlled district\nheating must me massively extended.\n\nThe current in-house technology is based on water as a carrier, which makes it\ndifficult to exchange with more intelligent air conditioning systems.\n\n## Savings in the Heating Sector\n\nThe major step here is not the switch of technologies. Especially with our\nbuildings, we can also achieve a lot by saving energy.\n\nSaving energy in heating does not mean, we have to live in the cold from now on\nand everyone whose living room has more than 19 degrees is a climate change\ndenier. No. Savings come from better insulation.\n\nAt the moment, the range is wide. While a typical old building needs 250\nkWh/m²a, a passive house usually uses a tenth of it (less than 25 kWh/m²a).\nRegulations of 1995 still allowed around 200.\n\nBut insulation measures have a problem. The physics is pretty fragile. If you\ninsulate only one part (e.g. better windows) or if you do it wrong (e.g.\ninsulate on the inside of the wall), mould is coming. So DIY is usually ruled\nout and a heavy investment is needed.\n\nThere is an obligation to renovate in Germany and these laws are likely to be\ntightened in the future. But this is another cost item on the shoulders of\nproperty owners.\n\nTherefore the whole sector has to be controlled by a sophisticated subsidising\nprogram from the state, that distributes the money to the people and projects\nwho need it most, millions of times in the next years. But the sector will\nremain the slowest, also because cars are switched more often than houses.\n\n## The End of the World (As We Know It)\n\nSaving the world from the climate crisis is the most pressing and demanding\ntopic of our time. As you have seen, it needs radical restructurings in almost\nall economic sectors, it even needs restructuring in our society. But I can\nassure you that it would need even more investment and restructuring if we\ndidn't do anything. Yet it's highly complex.\n\nWell, collecting all the data alone was pretty complex. I've done this in a\nseries of posts in 2022 and early 2023 and I spawned three Storylines to be able\nto cover every aspect in enough depth. Besides this one about Energy as a whole,\nas mentioned before, there is another one about [traffic](/storylines/traffic)\nand a [vegan series](/storylines/vegan), that I can recommend.\n\nI've found out a lot along the way. But it's not enough.\n\nThis \"not enough\" has two sides. What we're doing right now is by far **not\nenough**. Humans are short-sighted. The profit of the next quarter is still more\nimportant than the loss in ten years. We are so far behind that we can only hope\nto end with 2 degrees more temperature in 2050.\n\nThe second side is knowledge. The problem stays utterly difficult. Tipping\npoints here, synergies there. So a bunch of small posts are **not enough** to\nget a grasp on the topic, although everyone should know about this. Knowledge is\nthe key to solving the problem.\n\nI'll try to continue to compress the information that I find into small bits.\nThis series is over, but I will come up with new material.\n\nLet's see if we continue to steer towards the end of the world or if we find a\nproper navigation device to male the u-turn."

      "It is late October 1904. My name is Camil Constantin. I am a chronist at the\nKronstadt registry and this is aggregation report number 411-1904-101. My\nassignment lies in gathering all available information about the \"Drac\nIncidents\" that took place more than 400 years ago.\n\nMy work involves a journey to Schäßburg, where the registry of Kronstadt\nmaintains an outpost. I am writing this from the coach that is supposed to bring\nme to the local registry. It is my third day in this torturing vehicle, it rains\nall the time and we have to make many stops. A gathering with the local director\nis scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nThe Drac Incidents are events that we classify as type D. The Hermetic Society\nmust under no circumstances be known to the public. Type D cases are large\nbreaches of this rule. I have the honour to follow up on one of the most famous\nof them. Unfortunately, the latest developments demand a thorough reappraisal.\n\nWhy do I have to deal with such an old case now, you might ask? Well, the reason\nis a much more recent incident of type B, filed under the name \"Stoker\". It is\nabout the publication of a book by the honourable Hermetic Society member Bram\nStoker.\n\nThis man is currently listed in the Registry of Dublin as a level 7 Hermetic.\nHowever, he is better known for his athletic abilities, electro shock\nexperiments and his writings. The reason for this investigation is his novel\n\"Dracula\", published seven years ago, which is based on the old Drac Incidents,\nbut consciously gave a wrong interpretation of the events.\n\nIt is now on me to find out what in the book is historically correct, what is\npoetic imagination and what could be dangerous for the Society. I am absolutely\nsure that Stoker will land in front of a Hermetic court and that these\ninvestigations will bear all evidence for the case. Time will tell if he will be\nconvicted or not. I for one promise to be as impartial as possible.",
      "I was hoping to stay overnight in Schäßburg before my planned visit. But the\ncoach, the road holes and the weather disrupted my plans. Totally exhausted, I\ncame to the huge wooden door in one of the city wall towers, the tailor's tower,\nand knocked using a heavy iron ring decorated with a wolf's head.\n\nI sensed quite some hermetic power as someone approached the entrance from the\ninside. The heavy door opened slowly and with the appropriate, authentic sound.\nThe administrator was smaller and younger than I expected, a scraggy little guy\nwith goggles on his nose.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he asked in a voice that told me that he probably hadn't talked\nfor weeks.\n\n\"My name is Camil Constantin,\" I said. \"I believe we have an appointment.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, yes. I expected you yesterday. I hope everything is fine. My name is\nMaxim Radu Lazar. Please come in!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm glad to be here now\", I answered while I stepped into the dark and low\nentrance hall. I had to duck and watch my head.\n\nDirectly after a small snack that Lazar had prepared, he showed me the archive\nand the relevant sections. During the next days, we took our time to dive deeply\ninto the material of that time. We had to research five years of primary and\nsecondary sources. I myself had analysed the higher level sources already in\nKronstadt. Here in Schäßburg there was one name that dominated all reports,\nEgmond Bedeus von Scharberg.\n\nHe was an archivist here in the Registry for over two decades in the mid 15th\ncentury. He seemed to have eye witnessed the case and reported more or less all\nof the files. The first fact I found unusual was that he was also was\nresponsible for some secondary material, not at all according to the Registry's\nstandards. Conclusions had to be made by an independent other person and not by\nthe same guy who collects the bare facts.\n\nAnother part of our research therefore concentrated on the messenger himself.\nEgmont was a dominant guy. He seemed to have only one assistant at that time and\nin his conclusions, he always was very reluctant. That might be the reason why\nthe incidents lasted so long. He must have been involved personally.",
      "In the end, it took us five full days to sift through and catalogue the\nmaterial. Nine out of ten resources came from Sir Egmont. So we focused mainly\non the other ten per cent and the material I brought from outside. That gave us\na somehow more reliable picture of Vlad Tepes.\n\nFor all we know, he was a charismatic man, not at all like his crude father, the\none they called \"Dracul\" at first. Vlad didn't slaughter men and ate them for\nbreakfast. Instead, he gathered groups of Hermetics around himself, held parties\nand presumably also orgies. He had a big entourage and surely some of them were\nshadier than the average Transylvanian, while others were renowned members of\naristocratic families that came from all over Europe.\n\nThe core of the scandal around Vlad, however, was something different. He wanted\nto go public. He wanted to break rule number two of the Hermetic Society and\ntell the world who we are. That was why Egmond the Chronist tried to stop Vlad.",
      "Thankfully, after this week of dusty research, we had some leads to follow. I\ntook Maxim with me, this time on a much longer journey to the archives in\nVienna.\n\nThe weather on this trip was not better than my previous experience. But this\ntime I had company. Maxim was a pleasant travel partner and throughout the days,\nwe could even work on some of the material. After three weeks, we arrived at the\nbiggest registry of the region in Vienna. And we had a plan on how to start the\nsearch.\n\nOnly two hours later, we already had reasonable doubts about our past findings.\nVlad the son was the devil, not his father. The father, Vlad II., only made the\nmistake to sell his son in young age to a sultan and somehow caused all this\nmisery.\n\nAnother fact awakened our interest. Lady Lucy Westenra appeared in several\nreports in the archive and also in Bram Stokers novel. Many others seem to be\nfictional. Westenra, however, was a registered hermetic at level 6. She either\nseemed to play the role of a conspirator or a seduced victim. The sources were\nat that point still unclear. So we had material to speculate while staying over\nnight.\n\nIt was clear that we needed more time.",
      "Twice. We investigated twice in the wrong direction, first Vlad and then this\nWestenra lady. This is not me. Usually, I don't make these kinds of mistakes. I\nseemed to be biased. So the next steps had to be done with more clarity. We\nmoved our focus to the prosecutor, who was appointed to the case after it\nescalated due to the incompetence of Scharberg, Observer Abraham van Helsing.\n\nThat part in Stokers' book sounded absurd and unrealistic, but we stumbled upon\nthe name in one of von Scharberg's notes and later on, we found the official\nassignment papers. This man existed. So we tracked him down. He was registered\nin the Amsterdam registry at level eight. What a surprise, a worthy arch-nemesis\nfor Vlad. So no wonder that someone made a book out of it.\n\nHe was an executive observer for the Hermetic Court in Vienna at that time. So\nafter the first rumours reached the city, the authorities handed him over the\ncase. His task apparently was not only to catch Vlad and drag him to court. No.\nHis task was to end this episode, to crush the vampire cult in the making.\n\nOf course, we also found more twists around the plain historic facts. The notes\nof van Helsing showed many details and references to Mehmed II., the great\nemperor. Vlad had been held hostage in the Ottoman Empire for some years in his\nyouth. Some sources said he grew up together with Mehmed and his siblings.\nOthers said, he just heard about them in his cruel prison.\n\nIn any case, Vlad, the powerful Hermetic, held a grudge against Mehmed II., a\ngrudge so huge that he impaled Mehmed's envoys and entourage in the Walachia and\nattacked Ottoman territories in Bulgaria. This included the slaughter, that we\nexpected from him in the meantime.\n\nAnyway, back to the novel. Vlad formed the idea of his cult from the time when\nhe escaped the prison of his youth and grew it bigger and bigger throughout and\nafter his countless battles. And that is the fabric that Bram Stoker's book is\nmade of.\n\nThe case was now crystal clear to me. Just in time for the hermetic court.",
      "It is July 1905. I am at the Hermetic High Court in London and it is right\nbefore the start of the trial against the famous Bram Stoker. I just made my\nlast observation regarding the case today, here at the courthouse.\n\nThroughout the past arduous months, I have collected all the details of two\ncases, the one that is on trial today, Bram Stoker against the Hermetic Society\nand the quite disruptive case of Vlad, the Impaler. I've travelled through the\ndarkest regions of Europe and got buried under tons of bureaucratic reports and\nunreadable paperwork.\n\nI have uncovered all the relations between Stoker's novel and the real events\nand all its witnesses and collaborators, except for one name. Jonathan Harker,\nthe solicitor in the novel. And today, I have found out that it is the name of\nBram Stoker's barrister. I saw him here in the halls and it is very likely that\nBram Stoker based the fictional character on the real one. Last mystery solved.\n\n\"Camil Constantin?\" the announcer called out. It was my turn.\n\nI stood up and entered the courtroom. The strict and conservative Judge Farcas\nhad the chair. But there were also others in the room. Bram Stoker was not there\nyet. Jonathan Harker represented him and said that the writer would arrive later\nwhen I was supposed to give my statement.\n\nThere were also four representatives of the Registry and the Observers, I assume\nlawyers and two further judges that monitored the neutrality of the procedure. A\nhermetic trial differs a bit from a civil one. Farcas, the judge fully owns the\nprocess. He is asking questions and he manages the timing and the heard\nwitnesses. The backup judges can only veto if something unjust is happening.\n\nSo Farcas was swearing me in and explained the circumstances and the charge to\nme. After about half an hour of bootstrapping procedure, he called for a lunch\nbreak.\n\nNow, two hours later, I am standing here in front of him to give my\ninterpretation of the proceedings around Vlad Tepes and Stoker and filling them\nwith so much proof that the case should be clear.\n\nI was nervous as I entered the witness box. My heart was pounding another bit\nmore when the door opened and the accused, Bram Stoker in person came in and sat\ndown next to his lawyer.\n\nFarcas took his wooden hammer and called for silence. “Let us get started,\" he\nbegan.\n\n“Please state your full name and role in this trial”, continued the judge.\n\n“Constantin, Sir”, I said slightly shyer than I usually am. “My name is Camil\nConstantin, and I am a chronist for the Hermetic Registry. About one year ago, I\nwas assigned to this case and took over a full research procedure in several of\nour archives.” I continued setting out the boring details of my assignment and\nthe sources I had used. Then the judge posed the opening question.\n\n“What according to your sources happened four hundred years ago, Mr.\nConstantin?\" he started.\n\n“Vlad Tepes, your honour, is Dracula. This is clear to me now. Several facts of\nthe historical figure and the book are aligned. But what actually happened is in\nsome important details different than what the book says. Vlad’s father was\ncalled Dracul. He was a knight in the Catholic Drac Order, hence the name, and\nfought against the Osman Empire. Vlad the son was called Draculea or Son of the\nDragon, hence that name, that later turned into Dracula. The father had to give\nthe son away to the Osmans after losing several battles.\n\nWhat none of the parties knew at that time was that Vlad was a level eight\nhermetic who had just started to develop his abilities. Now you add rage against\nhis kidnappers and against his father. And you get a glimpse of the person Vlad\nDracula had become.”\n\nI just started getting excited about telling the whole story when the judge\ninterrupted.\n\n”OK, thank you Mr. Constantin”, he said. Can you jump forward a little? What has\nhappened to the Draculean Society?”\n\n“Sorry, your honor\", I replied, “Of course. Allow me one last sentence about the\nperson we are dealing with. Vlad in his early twenties was both frightening - he\nimpaled dozens of people, mostly Osmans - and charismatic. As a Walachian\naristocrat, he had a lot of influence. And as a Hermetic, he surely had the\nmental power to convince others easily.\n\nAfter some failed attempts by local Hermetic authorities to introduce him into\nan order, he founded one himself, the Draculean Society. And charismatic and\nwell connected as he was, he attracted quite a few hermetics not only from the\nregion. They came from far away. Lady Westenra was one of them for example. By\nthe time he was twenty-seven he had assembled quite an entourage in his castle.\n\nNow I come to the core of the story, your honour, I promise.\n\nAfter all I found out, I am sure it was Vlad himself, who planned to go public\nwith the Draculean Society. That means, he wanted to break the second major rule\nof the Hermetic Society and tell everyone about Hermetics and our shadow world\nthat pulls the strings.\n\nHe had convinced all of the puppets he gathered around himself and he already\nhad an infamous reputation in the region. So I assume he already had made the\nfirst steps when our authorities started to investigate.\n\nThere was a chronist called Sir Egmond Bedeus von Scharberg, who did a lot on\nhis own initiative and therefore complicated the situation rather than solving\nit. And then there was the Observer Abraham Van Helsing, finally instated by the\nHermetic Court to deal with the situation.”\n\n“Very well, now I suppose we get closer to the heart of this case, don’t we?\nGood Mr Constantine. So now let’s jump forward another bit. I have read the\nnovel in preparation for this case and we have already heard testimonies of the\npublishers stating the popularity of this concotion. How is this now connected\nto the actual events?”\n\n“Well as you have read the book, some of the characters that I have mentioned in\nmy statement might have sound familiar, haven’t they?”, I told the judge, who\nlooked back at me as if I had used swear words and I returned to my humble self\nagain.\n\n“Sorry, you honour. Van Helsing is a prominent example with many similarities to\nthe character in the book. I could trace back many others to historic figures\nand registered Hermetics and unmask some as pure fictional. So there are certain\nparallels.\n\nAlso some of the historic facts themselves align well with Stoker's story.\n\nBut the book diverges in important details. It does not mention Hermetics\nexplicitly although it contains some aspects of mind manipulation. It also\ndoesn’t mention the secret lodges or other structures of the Hermetic Society.\nIt adds additional fantastic elements, Stoker calls it Vampirism, which is in my\neyes so unrealistic, that most people will automatically depict it as pure\nfiction.\n\nIf you ask me, the whole drama will be forgotten soon and everybody will live on\nagain as it always happens.”\n\n“You better leave the conclusions to me,\" said the judge harshly. “But thank\nyou. Now that is enough for now. You are preliminarily dismissed, Mr.\nConstantin. You may follow the trial in the audience. Please stay until the end\nin case I need you for clarifications.”\n\nTo be honest, I felt bad after my statement. It was as if I had done something\nwrong. Probably I was too brisk as always. I sat down on a bench in the\naudience. But the session for today was almost over anyway.\n\nAfter hearing another witness for only five minutes, the judge gave the sign.\n\n“The trial will continue tomorrow at eleven”, he said and went out of the court\nroom through his personal door followed by the other judges and the usher.\n\nMy research was really thorough. The dossier I created has been handed over to\nthe judge in addition to my statement. So I was sure that all was correct. And\nyet I didn’t sleep very well that night. I was also not really sure what I\nwanted, what verdict I expected. Did I want Stoker in jail? I guess not. After\nall the novel was not so bad, I admitted to myself. I reassured myself that I\nwas so neutral, that I didn’t even form an opinion about the accused.",
      "The next day, when I entered the court room, Stoker wasn’t late. He already sat\nin his chair next to one of his book characters and I had to think about that\nagain. Probably we’re talking about fiction and art after all, aren’t we?\n\n“All rise”, shouted the usher as Judge Farcas came in. Following a few seconds\nof adjusting and waiting for silence, he started.\n\n“I have heard enough”, Farcas said followed by a murmur in the audience. There\nwere at least five witnesses left on the list.\n\n“The case is clear. I could make up my mind through a thorough comparison of the\nnovel itself with the actual events as reported by Mr. Constantin over here in\naddition to the evidence he and some other chronists had brought to the table.\nAt this time I have no reason to doubt these documents, nor their testimony.\nTherefore, all rise please.”\n\nThe murmuring and whispering in the audience grew again and the noise of a small\ncrowd standing up and moving chairs was added to the carpet of sound before\neverything fell silent again.\n\nThen he began to read out the verdict. “The accused, Mr. Bram Stoker, honorable\nmember of the Hermetic Society and the Trinity Order, Second Division,\nregistered in Dublin Ireland, is hereby found guilty of infringement of Rule\nNumber Two of the Hermetic Pact. You have violated the commandment of secrecy.”\nAfter this announcement, the murmur continued and the old judge had to make a\ngesture to calm the audience down to be able to continue his remarks.\n\n“I hereby sentence you to pay one pound sterling to the hermetic society”, he\nsaid and just like everyone else in the room, I had to think a little to\nunderstand. A symbolic sentence. Then I also saw the relief coming back into\nStoker’s face. “You may remain a member of the Society and also of your local\nlodge in Dublin.”\n\n“Let me explain my reasoning. You may all sit down”, he then continued. “There\nare quite a few parallels between the real events and the fictional story.\nTherefore, you have indeed misused your secret knowledge and brought a\nsignificant part of Hermetics into public consciousness. But on the other hand,\nthe story is distorted to such an extent that the very nature of our\norganisation can’t be deduced.\n\nI want to add one personal note. I disagree in one point with Mr. Constantin's\ninterpretation. I think this story will not fade away anytime soon. It will\nstick. I’m sure we’ll hear more about these vampires at other times. Urban\nlegends are challenging to control and you, Mr. Stoker have set one of them free\nand connected it forever with the Hermetic Society.\n\nSo don’t repeat that mistake. Rest assured that the next sentence will not turn\nout so mildly.”"

      "People usually don't believe that our current food consumption is a major player\nin the climate crisis. I have to admit that the connections are very\ncomplicated. They're going from methane in the digestion cycle of cows through\ntransport to rainforest clearing in Brazil. I'd like to get a grip on that\nmyself. That's why I'd like to dedicate part two of my posting series about the\nclimate crisis to this topic.\n\nOn top of that, the climate is only one of many plagues meat consumption causes.\nIt's also the main driver of the decline in biodiversity. It causes serious\nhealth issues driven by lies triggered by a cruel meat and milk lobby. and by\nthe way, it's completely unethical.\n\nI myself chose to be a vegan eight or nine years ago and I've learned a lot\nabout the other topics along the way. The possibilities for a vegan diet have\nincreased ever since. The topic is booming. I'm sure it's not a trend that will\ngo away anytime soon.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI'd like to start my journey into veganism with a look into the future, it's a\nsci-fi magazine after all. We are on a camping ground, mainly because I'm\nwriting this from the side of a camper van. 50 years fast forward.\n\nThe old couple next to us is classy. They drink their red wine from proper\nglasses. And they sit in front of a miniature screen watching TV shows each\nevening. I haven't seen such a thing for a long time. But they enjoy it. He, a\nman with a white long beard and a lot of tattoos, is a smoker. But he's not into\ncigarettes. I haven't seen such stupid things for decades either. No. He's\nsmoking his food.\n\nFor the whole day he's following a ritual. He prepared a seitan dough with\ndozens of spices, precooked it and now it's under the smoker. Soon, it will be\nroasted on the grill for the final touch.\n\nWhat you get in the market, he said, is all fake. You have to do it yourself.\nIt's as cheap as flour, dead simple and the tastiest thing you'll ever eat.\n\nThen they invited us for dinner.",
      "The previous thoughts point out the inevitable, the future we're steering to. We\nwill develop into a vegan world. It's not an option to choose from in the\nfuture. It's the opposite. It will be a very expensive option to eat meat, eggs\nor dairy products from time to time. And as it has no additional value, people\nwill just stop doing it.\n\nWhile many of us are still in denial, we are already transitioning into that way\nof life. Farmers see more and more problems with livestock farming. Feed gets\nmore expensive and subsidies from the states will become less and less. On the\nother hand, vegan products become more versatile and are healthier by design.\nPeople notice that spices are vegan and therefore vegan food does not taste like\nnothing. Also the rituals built around meat - barbecues, sunday roast and full\nmonty breakfast will have worthy replacements even without french cream sauce,\ncheese finishers or omelette.\n\nIt is happening, we know that. And now it's time to dive into the why.\n\n## Dimensions\n\nI just want to give you some relation between nature and livestock.\n\n- 4% of mammal-related biomass is bound to **wild animals**.\n\n- 36% are **humans**. We outweigh the rest of the animals by a factor of nine.\n\n- 60% is **livestock**. The farming animals that we use as food.\n\nThe biggest part there is **cattle**, which by coincidence is also a large\nsource of methane and therefore plays a huge role in the greenhouse effect.\n\nAnother overall side effect is that we use more and more land for farming, i.e\ngrowing soy for feeding the animals and grazing itself. This devastatingly\naffects the planet's biodiversity. It also shrinks the rainforest (e.g. in\nBrazil), which approaches a tipping point if it's getting reduced by another\n18%. At that point, it can't maintain its microclimate anymore and will dry out.",
      "Some people say that moving to a vegan diet would have one of the biggest\npositive effects for a private person's footprint. But in public discussions, it\nis almost never mentioned.\n\nThe complex set of factors is touching all aspects of the climate crisis and\nthus the topic is even harder to grasp as the climate change as a whole.\n\nThe most comprehensive and obvious part plays a significant role. Cows are\nproducing methane. About 30% of the total planetary emission. But this is only\nresponsible for 2% of the green house effect. The same amount goes to Nitrogen\nfertilizers for feed production. But many other effects are also included:\n\n- Production\n- Transport\n- Deforestation\n\nThe current estimation of the overall\n[share of the meat and dairy industry](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/land-forstwirtschaft/beitrag-der-landwirtschaft-zu-den-treibhausgas#treibhausgas-emissionen-aus-der-landwirtschaft)\nis **14%**. When we only fight with the sources of the emissions and don't\nchange our habits, the share will rise to **23%-27% in 2030** and up to **80% in\nthe year 2050**. For more details and sources, I recommend the german\npublication\n[Fleischatlas](https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/2022-01/Boell_Fleischatlas2021_V01_kommentierbar.pdf).\n\nIt's hard to change the behaviour of the people. But in this sector, we have\nproof that it's inevitable.\n\n## Let's Set It in Relation\n\nTime for a small recap session. We found out that meat and dairy have a 14%\nshare in climate change.",

      "The chart shows, that you can shave off 71% from your 500% over-budget emission\nwith a vegan diet. In comparison if you get rid of your car\n([average in europe](https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Topic/Transport/Car.html)),\nyou can only save 66% of the budget. The improvement is not huge, but it is\navailable right now for everyone. It just has to make click in your head.\n\nMass meat and dairy production, however, come with a much bigger footprint in\nanother crisis: **Biodiversity**. I know. Yet another crisis doesn't even fit in\nour heads anymore. But fighting the climate crisis the right way might come with\nmany synergies with stopping the extinction of species, when you do it the right\nway. It will be worth it, because in a climate catastrophe, many of us will\nsuffer, but after a biodiversity ELE all humans will be wiped out.\n\n## Pillars of Veganism\n\nGoing vegan has three pillars. In the last episodes, we have covered some ground\non one of them - sustainability and climate protection. In the next passages,\nI'd also dive into the other aspects. So let's start with speciesism and animal\nrights.\n\n**Speciesism** in its clearest form is when you love your little designer dog\nand at the same time have fur around your neck from one of its\nancestors/siblings. But it's more than that.\n\nIt's baked (wrong word, I know, butchered would be better) even into the\nlanguage. In English, you differentiate between cow and beef, calf and veal, pig\nand pork.\n\nAlso, meat is an abstraction in itself. A ridiculous argument against vegans is\nthat they substitute meat with \"identically looking alternatives\", while a\nsausage looks nothing at all like the original, too. Together with the\nabstraction, its background wiped from our conscious mind.\n\nPeople even think that organic meat - where animals have 30 cm more space -\nwould be less cruel. No. Someone cuts these throats as well in the end.\n\nThe aspect of respecting **animal rights** is the most important part of\nveganism. Two simple narratives from different perspectives describe very well,\nthat animals should have rights just as humans do. Let's call it cat/cow\naccording to the Yoga position.\n\n- Cat: If you've ever lived with a pet, e.g. a cat, you automatically get to\n  know their character. I believe there is no way to unsee that the animal has a\n  personality that must be protected. They're a friend. They depend on you,\n  speak in their own language with you and you understand most of it. They\n  express thoughts, feelings and needs.\n\n- Cow: And on the other hand, if you've ever looked into the processes of a\n  slaughterhouse (I recommend the documentary \"Cowspiracy\" for a start), you\n  immediately know that it is utterly wrong what's happening there. It will be\n  impossible for many people to accept these conditions just for a steak.\n\nEven without written law, this will become clear. Animal Rights are not up for\ndiscussion. There will be cases where it doesn't seem that obvious. So it's also\nvery simple to draw the line. Just include all animals.\n\n## Health\n\nThis storyline about veganism started with the climate crisis and already came\nto its centre, animal rights. But there's one more pillar to cover: health.\nLet's start with a part that is mentioned less often. Most of the recent\npandemics are caused by transmission paths that involve meat.\n\nWith today's hygiene standards, we can more or less exclude direct transmissions\nas in the medieval plague. The only remaining vectors are mosquitos/insects with\nmalaria as an example. The rest of the pandemic incidents went through steps\nthat involve meat production and consumption with horrendously expensive side\neffects.\n\nTake corona as an example. The patient-0 transmission can be traced back pretty\nprecisely in the meantime. It can be located with a precision of five meters\naround one spot on an open raw meat market (a so-called \"wet market\") in Wuhan,\nChina. The original carrier was a bat with probably another host (Tanukis are in\nthe discussion) in-between. All avoidable in a vegan world.\n\nThe reason why I became a vegan in the first place was my personal health. I was\nnot sick, but I felt my veins getting plugged with cholesterol and my metabolism\ngetting enriched with poison. And then, one day, I took the decision to stop. At\nthat point, I didn't know all the details. But I felt better day by day.\n\nThere were 800 significant studies about meat in 2015 already and it's well\nknown that animal protein is carcinogenic. The China Study (I also recommend the\nbook by T. Colin Campbell) is about a region in China where people were\ncoincidentally living vegan and could be examined in all areas of physiology.\nThe result was stunning. 80 - 90 % of all cancer and heart diseases and diabetes\ncases can be avoided with a vegan diet.\n\nSo why don't we all live vegan then? This is where lobbyism comes in. For\ngenerations, we are taught that milk is healthy and meat is needed to feed our\nbrains. Now meat production and pharmaceutics are unstoppable trillion dollar\nindustries.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nVeganism is no religion, as many claim. I think it's two things: a set of rules\nthat help you easily navigate through the giant stream of consumption. When you\nfollow them, you (not always, but) most likely do the right thing for your body,\nthe environment and in any case for the animals. And it's also a mindset. It's\nthe thought that we evolved from other animals and therefore we can't draw a\nline.\n\nIn this article, I've discovered what effects dairy and meat have on us and our\nenvironment. it is inevitable that the whole human race is more and more\nacquiring the vegan mindset.\n\nThis is not a \"we should one day\" or an \"if we did that, the world would be\nbetter\". No. It is an existing process. This transformation is already\nhappening. If you take a closer look, you will see that this great opposition is\nonly the last childish rebellion against common sense."

      "If you don't want to wait years and generations until you reach another star\nsystem, your science fiction stories have to imagine a propulsion system that\nallows space travel that is faster than light. At least that is one possible\nsolution to the dilemma.\n\nI needed this technobabble, that's how they called it in Star Trek productions,\nfor my space operas, so I've created a consistent story about how humanity\ndiscovered the real nature of the universe a long time ago. A lot of my sci-fi\nstories will use it as the background noise of their universe and my first Alien\nrace, that I've designed would have never been discovered without the FTL\ndrives.\n\nI called my solution the nine-dimensional **Transspace**. And bear with me, the\nidea is at least thirty years old and might seem a bit dusty compared to some\nmodern twists, but it has some cool side effects, that acted as seeds of stories\nand ideas.\n\nSo no space opera without a faster-than-light drive. Let's finally dive into the\ntopic.\n\nMy idea was not to bend space or fly through a portal. I've just extended the\nknown space time with some useful additional dimensions (just like the real\nphysicists did extensively for a while). Mainly I thought if the space is\nbending, where does it bend into. So there had to be more than the observable\ndimensions. That was my starting point.\n\nA view of my imagined multiverse simplified through the looking glass of popular\nscience comes with 9 dimensions.\n\n- Three of them are the **space** dimensions - basically the ones we know.\n- Three more are **time** dimensions. One of them is the linear time that we\n  live in. The others are splitting up the world into a multiverse of\n  possibilities.\n- The last three are bound to **gravity**. Our existence is connected to two of\n  these dimensions. We live on a gravitational plane, so to speak.\n\nI especially played around with the gravitational part of the theory. There were\nimmediate and reasonable associations to apply them to the daily life like the\npossibility to create ad-hoc force fields. This alone would be a life changing\ninvention.\n\nBut there is also the possibility to access a higher plateau than the one we\nlive on, which changes some relations between mass and distance and allows\nmoving faster than light.\n\nBut let's start with the well known space dimensions first.\n\n## Space\n\nSpace as a concept already existed in some form even in early antique theories.\nEinstein gave them the twist that these dimensions are curved or bent and that\nmass affects the amount of bending.\n\nThe (imaginary) Transspace has given them another angle that changed or extended\nsome of our imagination of the three space dimensions.\n\nThe theory itself has been discovered by humanity in a computer-assisted way. An\nAI and a quantum computer array have calculated most of the equations'\nsolutions.\n\nOne of these equations predicts that all dimensions fold into themselves. Very\nsimplified, you could say if you travel some billion years into the same\ndirection, you might be able to reach your starting point again. Just like a two\ndimensional creature walking on surface of a sphere.\n\nSome distant galaxy we observe with our telescope might even be our own milky\nway in its early days.\n\n## Gravity\n\nWe're getting one step more esoteric now. This part forms the perfect\ntechnobabble for space story essentials like anti-gravity and FTL travel and\ntherefore it marks the core of this world building exercise.\n\nNext to the space dimensions, there are also three gravitational dimensions,\nthat our senses and brains can't perceive. Our existence incorporates two of\nthese dimensions. We're living on a gravitational plane as told before.\n\nOnly on this plane, a meter is actually a meter and a kilogram is a kilogram.\nAnd more importantly, light speed and the gravitational constant are what they\nare. You move to another layer and things are different.\n\nIn the early days, after the theory had been postulated, people found out that a\ncertain geometry of force fields could form a tube or a passage that allows\nshifting to higher or lower gravity layers.\n\nThat made it possible to use the different circumstances over there and travel\nfaster - even surpass light speed. The theories have been taken over by\nengineers and it didn't take long to exploit the principles. But more on that\nlater.\n\n## Time\n\nLet's finish the basic dimensional concept first. The third group of dimensions\nafter space and gravity form the **time** continuum. The beautiful symmetry of\nthe theory also gives us three of them.\n\nHowever, we humans can only sense one. We live our lives on a timeline moving\npermanently in one direction.\n\nThe theory says that the other dimensions could contain alternate realities and\nform the multiverse of possibilities. The timelines next to us contain a\nsequence of events that is very similar to ours. Timelines further away are\nforming significantly different realities.\n\nHowever, it is technically not yet possible to prove the theories. Many\nscientists work on gravity effects, a handful also concentrate on the time\neffects of the theory. But there was no breakthrough yet. Thus, all of this\nremains theory for now.\n\nThe theory says that time travel is more complex than imagined. Going back in\ntime means contaminating a timeline, which automatically forms a new one. So you\ncan't go back into your own timeline and cause paradoxa.\n\n## The Discovery\n\nThe Theory of Transspace has been created by the dutch scientist **Marla Lay**.\nShe started to work on it during her PhD phase at the end of the 2080s and\npublished the groundbreaking paper in the year 2095.\n\nThe theory came with twelve base formulae and didn't contain any singularities\nany more unlike most of its predecessors. It was valid for all states of the\nuniverse from quantum events to massive singularities including the big bang.\nAnd still it could be considered a superset of the theory of relativity and the\nquantum theory for most aspects. Now, we could also predict the edge cases.\n\nAlthough Lay was in the lead, she already had a rather big staff and one of the\nbest quantum computer arrays to work with. Also later, she went through an\nunorthodox path and decided to involve the best scientists and engineers in the\nworld not only to peer review, but also to work on practical proof and potential\ntechnical inventions.\n\nBy the year 2095, Marla Lays theory was complete and confirmed correct, but the\npractical implications as well as the potential to affect the world was either\nunknown or mere speculation.\n\nOne year later, Lay with her good reputation and massive network of fellow\nscientists could convince seven other leading physicists and three engineers of\na two-year project called \"Enclave\". Project **Enclave** started in 2096.\n\nTogether with 50 other doctoral candidates and technicians, they founded a\nscience think tank in Noordwijk, Netherlands, which provided infrastructure for\nboth theoretical context and practical construction and experimentation.\n\nThey kept their discoveries close until the designated end in the year 2098,\nthus the project title Enclave.\n\nThe results were\n\n- a working, faster than light propulsion prototype\n- the so-called Grava drive that could project the first artificial force field\n- a science paper that was considered the seed of all later inventions\n\n## G-Tubes\n\nTwo of the participants in the Enclave project, **Charles Frempton**, an\nengineer and **Janice De Jong**, a data scientist, have worked on the\npossibility to enter deeper layers of the gravitational dimensions. This\ntechnology was considered the basis for Faster Than Light travel.\n\nThe problem had to be solved with raw computing power. It took them 18 months\nduring the enclave to find a geometric field that theoretically could have\nworked. Towards the end, they could present the first prototype, that generated\na small 80 cm diameter portal to a 25 times deeper gravitational layer - making\neverything 25 times faster than in our world without additional effort.\n\nLater on, Frempton created a probe that fitted through the hole. It made it to\nthe moon in 42 minutes using normal ionic propulsion.\n\nThey called that tube geometry \"G25\" but that was not the end. Over the years,\nother solutions have been found. The current maximum is G180k. So it went from\n25 to 180.000.\n\nThe conquering of the galaxy, that's what humanity was striving for after the\ndiscovery of the G-Tubes. At that time five big mining companies had already\nbeen the lords of the solar system.\n\nThe first human transspace flight in a G25 vessel engineered by two of the\nenclave participants, Wells & Bellman, was launched just 3 years later. It took\nthem 7 hours to Mars and they reached 3% of light speed.\n\nThe most versatile drive was invented in the 2140s, around 45 years later. The\nso-called Dublin Drive was specified as G121 and took 16 h to Titan, the moon of\nSaturn and an important outpost of Earth at that time.\n\nZodiac, one of the mining corporations found a specification for cargo and huge\nships at G1013 or G1k as it was called later. This drive was replaced only 21\nyears later by the G21k Starbase Drive, which itself created the kickstart into\ncolonising the neighbouring star systems. It took about 1 week per 10 light\nyears.",
      "Things that travel at the speed of light benefit most from the anatomy of space\ntime that the teams on the Enclave workshops had discovered. So FTL\ncommunication was one of the first thriving engineering fields that emerged.\n\nEven the miniature G-Tube geometries that were useless for humans had been good\nenough to send probes, robots and drones into transspace. The first series of\ntransspace communication phalanxes had settled at G171, which brought the moon\ninto high-speed real-time communication ranges of 8ms latency. And the delay for\ncommunication from Mars went down to 3 seconds on average, good enough for live\nstreams. The communication in the whole solar system had changed completely\nafter the rollout of the first generation.\n\nToday all colonies are connected through a fourth-generation communication\nsystem running on the mentioned G180k. This renders a reaction time of 22 ms\nwith the Titan colony and 90 minutes with a science station in the Rana system\nabout 30 lightyears away.\n\n## Force Fields\n\nOn an early milestone date, January 1st 2100, a company formed out of the\nenclave think tank launched a product they called \"Grava\", a brand name that\nwould become a synonym for force field tech afterwards.\n\nWithin two years, all excavators in the construction business had been replaced.\nOther companies licensed the technology and developed highly efficient planes,\nair trains and hoppers (shuttles that could enter space above Earth's\natmosphere).\n\nIn a modern space hopper, you will find 16 different Grava appliances. One of\nthem is responsible for a constant force vector, another for acceleration and\nagain others for accident protection or compensation of acceleration forces.\n\nThe space travel sector with its formerly expensive and risky launches profited\nthe most from the new Grava-based hoppers.\n\n## Time Travel\n\nThe last chapter of this world building exercise focuses on things not invented\nyet. Let's go back to time travelling. No pun intended. Even 100 years after the\nenclave, scientists have no practical idea how to do it, although some groups\nhave worked on it since the beginning.\n\nThe current state of the art speaks of two devices. The first is a temporal\nconverter (or Verter). It allows to slide along the regular time axis into the\nfuture and the past. The other one is called temporal polarizer (or Poler). This\nallows going from one timeline to another. It can find your own home timeline\nagain.\n\nBoth devices have been confirmed by theories as well as micro experiments. But\non a large scale, their complexity exceeds the mental and cybernetic capacities\nin the known space. It seems as if the universe could prevent a paradox just by\nmaking it too complicated to execute.\n\n## This is not the End\n\nTHe theories end here, at least the ones concerning the bare mechanics of this\nTransspace world. But I have found much more resources in my old notes. There\nwere drawings of starships with phantastic drives that resembled a mechanical\noctopus or an egg with a saturn ring. There were also schematic drawings of FTL\nflight modes and timelines that spread trees of possibilities. I must have spent\na lot of hours in my youth.\n\nBut I never took the next step of bringing this universe to life with real\nstories. In the meantime I have started to work on two. But I'm sure many more\nwill follow. I'm so curious."

      "During Corona, many of us were bound to our homes. From time to time, we had to\nmove our muscles somehow. What I did was going out for walks. Because we also\nmoved into another district, everything was new and had to be discovered.\n\nBy the end of the lockdown, we knew all of the streets and alleys and secret\ngreen pathways of our hood. Funnily we didn't know any of the shops, pubs and\nrestaurants around us, because they were closed.\n\nBut there is one depressing view that follows you when you go through the\nstreets of a city. Millions of parking cars. Gigantic immobile unneeded\nmountains of metal standing around. Some of them are three times as large as\nothers. Their design cries \"Attention, the boss is on the road\".\n\nEver since I can't get this picture out of my head again. Many cars are on the\nstreets again and move from place to place. But still, any parking space is\nfilled with such a tin man.\n\n**So why are we doing this to ourselves?**\n\n## EVs are not the solution\n\nLet's look at the seemingly green alternatives first.\n\nWhile with traditional combustion engines, the amount of kilometres is the most\ndestructive part for our environment, the new electrified vehicles have\nbatteries. And they cause the most damage while they are produced. That means\nmany cars that stand around in a parking position (the average car is parking\nfor 22.8 hours a day) is a highly inefficient way to use such a resource. Even\nmore so with battery-driven cars.\n\nThere are already some approaches:\n\n- Using the battery while the car is standing to store e.g. solar energy\n  produced by a building roof for the night. That seems interesting at the first\n  glance, but unflexible in the long run.\n\n- Recycling batteries gives them a slightly better eco-balance, but it doesn't\n  cover enough.\n\n- The only sustainable solution is a change in our mindset. Why do we have to\n  own cars? Why don't we share them? Why are we willing to stay in traffic jams\n  day-in and day-out?\n\nThe problem with classic cars powered by petrol/gasoline for the environment is\nobvious. For every 100 km, in an average Diesel, you spend 1% of your yearly CO₂\nbudget. So after 10,000 km your whole annual CO₂ budget is blown into the air.\n\nAlso, cars with combustion engines are incredibly inefficient. They use only 20%\nof it efficiently on average. The rest is heat. Fuel cells are at about 30% and\npure EVs are 64% efficient.\n\nBut let's revisit the EV's problem, the batteries. The production also uses\nenergy. A lot. And it uses resources that are not mined sustainably at the\nmoment. Also EVs carry their burden. Probably even similar in size - breaking\neven after about 100,000 km. While EVs can reach a lifespan of 1,000,000 km,\nthat's not exactly true, but it's still not a good situation.\n\nSo the only sustainable way out is to drive less or more efficiently. And\nthroughout the rest of this series, I'd like to dive away from these facts, that\nmost of us already know. I rather want to explore other possibilities and models\nand look a bit into a possible future.\n\n## Four Ways Out, Part 1: Car Sharing\n\nWe know that electric cars are better in many ways. Among others, they are\n[three times more efficient](https://www.tuev-nord.de/de/privatkunden/verkehr/auto-motorrad-caravan/elektromobilitaet/wirkungsgrad/)\nthan combustion engines. But we have to use their Batteries more efficiently to\nreduce their negative environmental effects relatively. That means, we have to\nmake use of them also in the remaining 22 hours to tackle both, efficient\nbattery use and the reduction of the sheer amount of cars.\n\nThe good news is that the most obvious solution already exists: **Car sharing**.\nHaving a pool of co-owned cars means that they are used more frequently. Their\nbatteries - bad in production and effective during operation - work much more\ntargeted and much longer in the post-break-even phase. Additionally, parking\nlots are emptier, streets are not bordered with metal blobs.\n\nOn top of that, we'd seesome nice side effects. The maintenance of the cars can\nbe handled professionally. And the latest and most efficient technology can be\ndeployed in higher frequencies.\n\nPeople just have to get used to the fact that they don't own their car any more.\nOne status symbol less.\n\n## Four Ways Out, Part 2: Public Transport\n\nWe've seen that there are options to overcome the design flaws of cars. But by\nfar the most advanced infrastructure these days is the already existing **public\ntransport** sector. Trains, subways and buses. However, it only ranks at\n[number four after cars](https://de.statista.com/infografik/9162/nutzung-von-verkehrsmitteln-in-deutschland/),\nwalking and bikes. The car is used 3 ½ times more often that .\n\nEven powered by fossil fuels, buses\n[emit less than 50%](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200317-climate-change-cut-carbon-emissions-from-your-commute)\nof CO₂-equivalent than a car assuming average occupancy rates. Trains and\nsubways are already powered by electricity without the drawback of unsustainable\nbatteries. And this system transports billions of people to their destination\nevery single day.\n\nOc course, it has drawbacks, too. First of all, it is a central system and thus\ndoes not scale well. Additional waves of passengers are stressing the already\nexhausted system. Due to its central control structure, it is also unflexible.\nDelays cause ripple effects throughout all its cog wheels, which results in more\ndelays. This causes the feeling of unreliability and discomfort, which might be\nthe reason why the personally owned car still gets more adoption.\n\nA second drawback is that the net does not equally expand into all regions.\nEspecially the remote rural areas have a huge disadvantage in terms of distance\nto the next pick up point and frequency of the service. This could only be\nsolved with more investment into the infrastructure.\n\n## Four Ways Out, Part 2: Intelligent Hybrid Systems\n\nSome days ago, we had to use a bus from the public transport system as well as a\ntaxi. The bus was almost empty - four passengers only, so both rides were not\nvery sustainable and also not cheap. In Hamburg and some other cities in\nGermany, there are more intelligent systems now - **intelligent hybrids**\nbetween public transport and car sharing / taxis. The system running in Hamburg\nis called Moya.\n\nThis system is running small EV buses, suitable for eight passengers and they\ncome with an algorithm powered centrally managed pickup system. As a passenger,\nyou request a ride with a smartphone app. Then the system chooses the best\ndrivers considering start and endpoint and alters their tour just a little bit\nto fit the new request in. You are not driving alone. Along the way, other\npassengers might be picked up as well.\n\nThis is quite an efficient way in the city. But again as a centralized system,\nit's hard to scale. Especially as it's also commercial, it has to be profitable.\nSystems like that usually don't work on the country side. But they can give a\nhint which systems might be a future-proof approach.\n\n## Four Ways Out, Part 2: Autonomous Driving\n\nLet's come to solution number four, the science fiction variant.\n\nThe infrastructure around cars is massive. Besides gigantic investments in\nmassive public infrastructure (roads, signs, traffic lights etc.), there is also\nthe personal side. A car always has a parking space where it rests for at least\n16 hours every day of the year. In many cases, this space is a garage that takes\naway space to live and construction resources. However, the dominant resource is\nthe driver. Yo need one person if the car is on the road.\n\nBut what if cars became drones and drove autonomously?\n\nThey could move 24/7. We could share them very efficiently, and wouldn't even\nneed a parking spot for them. People would get off and the car could directly\ndrive to its next assignment.\n\nAutonomous driving combined with intelligent services could become the future\nway of transport with similar flexibility like today but without the immense\nresource abuse.\n\nSome drawbacks remain: People still need to give up their need to own their\ncar-to-possess. Day in day out, people often have the same routes. Public\ntransport covers this more efficiently than autonomous car drones. So the\nsystems must be combined.\n\n## Travelling Further Away\n\nCars are everywhere. I guess they are by far the most visible means of\ntransport. But they cover only parts of the emission and demand for personal\ntransportation. Public transport and trains form another sector. We have that\nunder control. The one that is left is **flying**.\n\nPeople love going on holidays. Twice a year they use planes to get into warmer\nareas. Sometimes travelling 10.000 km or more spending 10 times the annual\nbudget just for one trip. Even more problematic are the often shorter business\ntrips, because they are more frequent and even less necessary in WFH and video\nconferencing times.\n\nThe problem is that there is no green replacement for jet engines yet. One day\nplanes might be propelled with Hydrogen or E-Kerosene, but that technology takes\nanother 10 or 15 years to produce the needed amounts, probably already too late\nfor Earth.\n\nUntil then, the only solution might be to slow down in our holidays and to get\non a train to visit your favourite Italian city or Spanish beach instead of Bali\nand Costa Rica.\n\n## A Future Vision\n\nIn this series, I've collected facts and figures about our transport system and\npossible alternatives. Cars as we know them are not the future. Flying and\nmoving goods around contributes to the bad reputation of that sector. So what\ncould sustainable transport look like?\n\nFor the daily moves, in the future probably everyone will have a combination of\noptions. None of them includes owning a car. You call your vehicle when you need\nit and some seconds later it stands in front of your door. It drives you to\nevery possible destination, snaps into efficient convoy flows and on mid- and\nlong-distance trips, you switch to comfortable high-speed trains.\n\nSometimes, people still take flights, but usually only transcontinental. But the\nplanes will be powered by hydrogen.\n\nAnd finally, all the goods of the world economy will travel slowly with almost\nzero energy ships powered by wind and sunlight.\n\nThe only problem is that nobody wants to give up on comfort. No one wants to\ntake a step back. But unfortunately, we will have to take that step back now to\nmake some comfortable leaps forward in the future."

      "_Louis_\n\nHello everyone, I'm Louis Guillory, Loo-Eee Gee-Yoo-Ree, that's how you\npronounce it. My grannie said, it's french, but my family lives here in New\nOrleans. Our ancestors were great sailors and explorers from Europe. I'd also\nlike to see the world someday, but mom didn't let me out of the house yet.\n\nWoah, but here in the house there is already so much to discover. Our family\nalone is huge. My grannie, my grandpa and his father, the wise Dr. Guillory live\nwith us. I have nine siblings and at least as many uncles and aunts and\ncountless cousins. Many of them live here in Mansion, our home. And there are\nalso our neighbours, the Landrys and not to forget the evil Fontenots, who own\nthe bar.\n\nAnother woah, I almost forgot to mention the most important thing. I am a\nteenage mouse. Well, that's not the important thing, that's normal, I guess. But\nyesterday, I have found out that I can fly. I was hovering, I swear.\n\n_Seraphine_\n\nGood morning, my name is Seraphine Guillory. I'd like to talk about my family\nand things. At the moment, I'm so annoyed by my brothers. I have eleven\nsiblings, most of them are nice. Fleur for example is so cool. Some of them are\nstill babies. But Louis and Remy are pranking the others all the time.\nTroublemakers, that's what they are.\n\nWhatever. Yesterday I found out something strange. I stood in front of the\nmirror shard in my little alcove and - I swear - I was half transparent. I could\nsee the wall behind me. It was just a second at first.\n\nI tried to concentrate and after a while, I could control it. Now I can become\ninvisible whenever I want. Isn't that great? I can go wherever I want without\nbeing seen.\n\nBut I promised myself that I will use my power only for good things. Not like my\nnasty brothers would do it. Speaking of which, now I have an advantage. I think,\nI should find out more about their plans.\n\n_Remy_\n\nHi, my name is Remy. Remy Guillory. Louis is my older brother and my best\nfriend. We spend every minute together. It never gets boring, I can assure you.\nBut today strange things happened and in the end, we couldn't stop laughing\nabout it. Believe it or not, we're supermice now.\n\nSo here's what happened. We moved around in our hood, the western walls of the\ndining room and the spaces above. So while we were running around the ceiling to\nreach the outer wall and the window area, my knees went to pudding, I stumbled\nand fell at high speed and overturned three times. Woah, what a stunt. It was so\ncool.\n\nThen Louis pulled my legs and they became longer and longer. They were elastic.\nMy body, too. \"Hold on to that nail\", he said and then he pulled more until I\nwas three times as large as normal. Long story short, I am elastic now whenever\nI want.\n\nLater on, Louis showed me that he could fly. We have superpowers, how epic is\nthat?",
      "_Seraphine_\n\nSeraphine knew that her two brothers were up to no good and decided to use her\nnew talent to observe them. She wanted to find out what they were planning. So\nshe made herself invisible and sneaked into a space in the wall, where they\nusually hang out.\n\nShe sneaked into the space, climbed some of the bars as silent as possible and\nconcentrated on here invisibility. If she had lost her focus, she found out, she\nwould have become half transparent like a ghost.\n\nThere they were. She could stand right next to them going unnoticed. But what\nshe saw next was a surprise. Louis was hovering some centimeters above the\nground. And Remy's belly was twice as long as normal and much thinner. She\ncouldn't hold focus again.\n\n\"What?\", started Remy to stutter. \"Louis, look, a ghost ...\"\n\n\"What the cat is going on?\", said all three almost simultaneously.\n\nThen they moved around each other. Louis also looked from the top. Remy bent\nhimself with his flexible body towards Seraphine while she flickered between\nsolid, transparent and invisible.\n\n\"Good weasel,\" said Louis, who was the first after a few long seconds of\nsilence. \"Seraphine is one of us, too. Hello Sera!\"\n\n\"Hell-loo weasel,\" she replied with a long drawn-out hello and a not-so-clever\nnickname she had pulled from her brother's statement. She hated that she\ncouldn't find anything cooler at that moment. She was not the most spontaneous\nmouse.\n\n\"Hi Sera,\" Remy added as if nothing had happened.\n\nBut then something happened. They started talking to each other and figured out\nwhat they could do. They started making plans, all three together. In their\nminds they had already conquered the world, or at least the Mansion. But most\nimportantly, they found out that they were not enemies. Instead, they had common\nenemies and they could name them.\n\nThere were the Fontenots from the bar in the basement, a truly snobby family.\nThere were also the \"Notorious Seven\", the seven squirrels who were constantly\nstealing food from their supplies. And let's not forget the cats, the Mansion's\nthree pet cats, who ate at least two of her great uncles. One evening Granny\ntold them this horror story, after which they couldn't sleep for two days.\n\nThe cats, the cats, thought young Remy. We should do something about these\nbeasts.",
      "_Louis_\n\nI don't know what to make of it, thought Louis. I mean Sera, my annoying sister.\nShe was one of us too? What would happen next? My dad flying around the corner?\nBut well, she's probably not as weird as I thought. Or - haha - we're all that\nweird. We're super mice. We're the Guillorys. Just like in one of the comics we\nfound under the roof when we visited our nephews, the Benoits.\n\nThe thoughts circled in Louis' head. And while he walked next to his little\nbrother and his twin sister, he carefully watched their facial expressions and\nknew that they were thinking the same.\n\n\"Remy, Remy,\" he finally said. It might have been the longest time in their\nlives, where didn't say a word to each other. Remy looked up, Sera, too. They\nstopped in front of the stairs in the wall that Grandpa had built.\n\n\"I was thinking about the cats,\" said Remy suddenly as if he had heard Louis'\nthoughts. What a surprise, he must have been five steps ahead because he was\nalready in the middle of his first adventure as \"The Wonderful Guillorys\".\n\n\"Okay,\" he continued. \"We know three of them, but maybe there are more on the\nother floors of the Mansion, right? But when we visited our nephews or went to\nthe bar, no one told us any stories about other cats. The only thing we know are\nthe scary stories from our grandma.\"\n\n\"You're right about that,\" I replied. \"But there's no doubt that they exist.\nWe've seen them many times and our parents trained us to hide from them. There's\nthe big, grumpy grey one with the long fur. Then there's the elegant, sporty one\nwith the spots and the little fluffy one. Once I saw the teeth of the grumpy\none. His canines were as big as my arm. They must just be monsters, no doubt.\"\n\nRemy's body trembled as Louis told him the details. His elastic form made it\nlook more comical than it should, and all three of them had to laugh out loud.\n\n\"Stop it,\" he said then. \"Let's find out more instead. Sera of the Wonderful\nGuillorys, probably your invisibility trick can help us.\"\n\n\"A recon mission,\" I said before Seraphine could answer. \"That's a great idea.\nPhase one of our first mission. Find out as much as we can.\"\n\n\"Well\", said Sera carfully, \"let me think. I always wanted to know more about\nthese beasts. Yea, all right, let's do it. I can observe. That's what I do best.\nQuickly, let's get back to our headquarters.\"",
      "_Seraphine_\n\nThey had made plans for several hours. Seraphine was surprised, that Remy was so\ngood at this. He had drawn a detailed plan of at least half of the floor and\nmarked with cat paw symbols where the three giant enemies usually could be\nfound.\n\nLouis on the other hand was the logistics expert. He had brought all sorts of\nsupply. Among other things, he had a small notebook and a little mirror shard\nwith which the mice could look around corners.\n\nBut Sera needed none of this. In fact, she couldn't even write. And also, only\nshe was invisible herself, not the things she carried and it looked pretty\nawkward when she tried to carry the notebook with her.\n\nThey decided to observe her from far while she could spy against the cats while\nstanding directly in front of them.\n\nEven more awkward than not seeing herself in the mirror was the thought that she\ncould just stroll towards the cats and they wouldn't notice her. The word she\nwas searching was actually not awkward. It was frightening.\n\nBut she had to do it. She had to overcome her fear. She had to be the brave in\nthe team. And so there she stood, in the living room of the mansion, 2 meters\naway from the fireplace and only half a meter in front of the fluffy one\nsleeping on a carpet. Her heart was beating so loud that she was afraid that the\ncat monster could actually hear it.\n\nShe stood there for at least a minute before she dared to move again. But it\nseemed to work. So she dared a bit more. Some steps first, then some more until\nshe stood in front of the huge closed eye directly next to the head of the\nmonster. She could see the fluffy fur on the cat's cheek. Then she made a\nmistake. Accidentally, she touched one of the whiskers and the cat opened its\neyes.\n\nSeraphine looked directly into the big green pupils that looked like gigantic\nheadlights in her mind. But nothing happened. The cat turned her head around and\ncontinued its nap. That was the moment she started to breathe again. She must\nhave held her breath for an hour or so. But in reality everything took only a\ncouple of seconds. The first experiment was successful.\n\nSo the Wonderful Guillorys continued their mission."

      "_Louis_\n\nHallo zusammen, ich bin Louis Guillory, Luu-Iiih Gie-o-Rie, so spricht man das\naus. Meine Oma sagte, es sei französisch, aber meine Familie lebt hier in New\nOrleans. Unsere Vorfahren waren große Seefahrer und Entdecker aus Europa. Eines\nTages möchte ich auch die Welt sehen, aber meine Mom hat mich noch nicht aus dem\nHaus gelassen.\n\nWoah, aber hier im Haus gibt es schon so viel zu entdecken. Unsere Familie\nallein ist riesig. Meine Oma, mein Opa und sein Vater, der weise Dr. Guillory,\nleben bei uns. Ich habe neun Geschwister und mindestens genauso viele Onkel und\nTanten und unzählige Cousins und Cousinen. Viele von ihnen leben hier in\nMansion, unserem Zuhause. Und dann sind da auch noch unsere Nachbarn, die\nLandrys und nicht zu vergessen die bösen Fontenots, denen die Bar gehört.\n\nUnd noch etwas, fast hätte ich das Wichtigste vergessen. Ich bin eine Maus. Nun\nja, das ist nicht das Wichtigste, das ist ganz normal, denke ich. Aber gestern\nhabe ich herausgefunden, dass ich fliegen kann. Ich habe geschwebt, ich schwöre\nes.\n\n_Seraphine_\n\nGuten Morgen, mein Name ist Seraphine Guillory. Ich würde gerne ein paar\nGeschichten über meine Familie und andere Dinge loswerden. Im Moment bin ich von\nmeinen Brüdern sehr genervt. Ich habe elf Geschwister, die meisten von ihnen\nsind nett. Fleur zum Beispiel ist so cool. Einige von ihnen sind noch Babys.\nAber Louis und Remy planen ständig Streiche mit den anderen. Störenfriede, das\nsind sie.\n\nWie auch immer. Gestern habe ich etwas Seltsames herausgefunden. Ich stand vor\ndem Spiegelsplitter in meinem kleinen Alkoven und - ich schwöre - ich war halb\ndurchsichtig. Ich konnte die Wand hinter mir sehen. Am Anfang war es nur eine\nSekunde.\n\nIch habe dann versucht, mich zu konzentrieren, und nach einer Weile konnte ich\nes kontrollieren. Jetzt kann ich mich unsichtbar machen, wann immer ich will.\nIst das nicht großartig? Ich kann gehen, wohin ich will, ohne gesehen zu werden.\n\nAber ich habe mir geschworen, dass ich meine Kräfte nur für gute Dinge einsetzen\nwerde. Nicht so, wie meine nervenden Brüder es tun würden. Wo wir gerade dabei\nsind, ich habe jetzt einen Vorteil. Ich denke, ich sollte mehr über ihre Pläne\nherausfinden.\n\n_Remy_\n\nHallo, mein Name ist Remy. Remy Guillory. Louis ist mein älterer Bruder und mein\nbester Freund. Wir verbringen jede Minute zusammen. Es wird nie langweilig, das\nkann ich Euch versichern. Aber heute sind seltsame Dinge passiert, und am Ende\nkonnten wir nicht mehr aufhören, darüber zu lachen. Ob du es glaubst oder nicht,\nwir sind jetzt Supermäuse.\n\nAlso, Folgendes ist wirklich passiert. Wir sind in unserer Gegend herumgelaufen,\nan den westlichen Wänden des Esszimmers und in den Bereichen darüber. Während\nwir also um die Decke herumliefen, um die Außenwand und den Fensterbereich zu\nerreichen, wurden meine Knie zu Pudding, ich stolperte, fiel mit hoher\nGeschwindigkeit und überschlug mich dreimal. Woah, was für ein Stunt. Das war so\ncool.\n\nDann zog Louis an meinen Beinen und sie wurden länger und länger. Sie waren\nelastisch. Mein Körper auch. \"Halt dich an dem Nagel fest\", sagte er und zog\nweiter, bis ich dreimal so groß war wie normal. Langer Rede, kurzer Sinn, ich\nbin jetzt elastisch, wann immer ich will.\n\nSpäter hat Louis mir gezeigt, dass er fliegen kann. Wir haben Superkräfte, wie\ngenial ist das denn?",
      "Seraphine\n\nSeraphine wusste, dass ihre beiden Brüder nichts Gutes im Schilde führten und\nbeschloss, ihr neues Talent zu nutzen, um sie zu beobachten. Sie wollte\nherausfinden, was sie vorhatten. Also machte sie sich unsichtbar und schlich\nsich in einen Raum in der Wand, in dem sie sich normalerweise aufhielten.\n\nSie kletterte so leise wie möglich über einige der Gitterstäbe und konzentrierte\nsich auf ihre Unsichtbarkeit. Hätte sie ihre Konzentration verloren, so stellte\nsie fest, wäre sie halb durchsichtig geworden wie ein Geist.\n\nDa waren sie. Sie konnte direkt neben ihnen stehen und unbemerkt bleiben. Aber\nwas sie dann sah, war eine Überraschung. Louis schwebte einige Zentimeter über\ndem Boden. Und der Bauch von Remy war doppelt so lang wie normal und viel\ndünner. Sie konnte sich nicht mehr konzentrieren.\n\n\"Was?\", begann Remy zu stottern. \"Louis, sieh mal, ein Geist ...\"\n\n\"Was zum Teufel ist hier los?\", sagten alle drei fast gleichzeitig.\n\nDann bewegten sie sich umeinander herum. Louis schaute auch von oben herab. Remy\nbeugte sich mit seinem biegsamen Körper Seraphine entgegen, während sie zwischen\nfest, durchsichtig und unsichtbar flimmerte.\n\n\"Gütiges Wiesel\", sagte Louis, der nach ein paar langen Sekunden des Schweigens\nder erste war. \"Seraphine ist auch eine von uns. Hallo Sera!\"\n\n\"Hallooooo, Wiesel\", antwortete sie mit einem langgezogenen Gruß und einem nicht\nganz so cleveren Spitznamen, den sie dem Ausruf ihres Bruders entnommen hatte.\nSie hasste es, dass ihr in diesem Moment nichts cooleres einfiel. Sie war nicht\ngerade die spontanste Maus.\n\n\"Hi Sera\", fügte Remy hinzu, als wäre nichts geschehen.\n\nAber dann passierte etwas zwischen den Geschwistern. Sie begannen miteinander zu\nreden und überlegten, was sie tun könnten. Sie fingen an, Pläne zu schmieden,\nalle drei zusammen. In ihren Köpfen hatten sie bereits die Welt erobert, oder\nzumindest das Herrenhaus. Aber das Wichtigste war, dass sie herausfanden, dass\nsie keine Feinde waren. Stattdessen hatten sie gemeinsame Feinde, und sie\nkonnten sie benennen.\n\nDa waren die Fontenots aus der Bar im Keller, eine wirklich versnobte Familie.\nDann gab es noch die \"Berüchtigten Sieben\", die sieben Eichhörnchen, die ständig\nEssen aus ihren Vorräten stahlen. Und nicht zu vergessen die Katzen, die drei\nHauskatzen der Villa, die mindestens zwei ihrer Großonkel gefressen hatten.\nEines Abends hatte Oma ihnen diese Horrorgeschichte erzählt, woraufhin sie zwei\nTage lang nicht schlafen konnten.\n\nDie Katzen, die Katzen, dachte der junge Remy. Wir sollten etwas gegen diese\nBiester unternehmen.",
      "_Louis_\n\nIch weiß nicht, was ich davon halten soll, dachte Louis. Ich meine Sera, meine\nnervige Schwester. Sie war auch eine von uns? Was würde als Nächstes passieren?\nMein Dad, der um die Ecke fliegt? Aber na ja, sie ist wahrscheinlich nicht so\nseltsam, wie ich dachte. Oder - haha - wir sind alle so komisch. Wir sind\nSuper-Mäuse. Wir sind die Wunderbaren Guillorys. Genau wie in einem der Comics,\ndie wir unter dem Dach gefunden haben, als wir unsere Neffen, die Benoits,\nbesucht haben.\n\nDiese Gedanken kreisten in Louis' Kopf. Und während er neben seinem kleinen\nBruder und seiner Zwillingsschwester herging, beobachtete er aufmerksam ihre\nMimik und wusste, dass sie dasselbe dachten.\n\n\"Remy, Remy\", sagte er schließlich. Es war vielleicht die längste Zeit in ihrem\nLeben, in der sie kein Wort miteinander gewechselt hatten. Remy schaute auf,\nSera auch. Sie blieben vor der Treppe in der Wand stehen, die Großvater gebaut\nhatte.\n\n\"Ich habe an die Katzen gedacht\", sagte Remy plötzlich, als hätte er Louis'\nGedanken gehört. Was für eine Überraschung, er muss fünf Schritte voraus gewesen\nsein, denn er steckte schon mitten in seinem ersten Abenteuer als \"Die\nWunderbaren Guillorys\".\n\n\"Okay\", fuhr er fort. \"Wir kennen drei von ihnen, aber vielleicht gibt es noch\nmehr in den anderen Stockwerken des Herrenhauses, oder? Aber als wir unsere\nNeffen besuchten oder in die Bar gingen, erzählte uns niemand Geschichten über\nandere Katzen. Das einzige, was wir kennen, sind die Gruselgeschichten von\nunserer Oma.\"\n\n\"Da hast du Recht\", antwortete ich. \"Aber es besteht kein Zweifel, dass sie\nexistieren. Wir haben sie schon oft gesehen, und unsere Eltern haben uns\nbeigebracht, uns vor ihnen zu verstecken. Da ist die große, mürrische Graue mit\ndem langen Fell. Dann gibt es den eleganten, sportlichen mit den Tupfen und den\nkleinen, flauschigen. Einmal habe ich die Zähne der Mürrischen gesehen. Ihre\nEckzähne waren so groß wie mein Arm. Das müssen einfach Monster sein, kein\nZweifel.\"\n\nRemys Körper zitterte, als Louis ihm die Details erzählte. Seine elastische Form\nließ es noch komischer aussehen, als es sein sollte, und alle mussten laut\nlachen.\n\n\"Hört auf\", sagte er dann. \"Lasst uns stattdessen mehr herausfinden. Sera von\nden Wonderful Guillorys, vielleicht kann uns Dein Unsichtbarkeitstrick helfen.\"\n\n\"Eine Aufklärungsmission\", sagte ich, bevor Seraphine antworten konnte. \"Das ist\neine großartige Idee. Phase eins unserer ersten Mission. So viel herausfinden,\nwie wir können.\"\n\n\"Nun\", sagte Sera fürsorglich, \"lass mich nachdenken. Ich wollte schon immer\nmehr über diese Biester wissen. Ja, in Ordnung, dann machen wir es. Ich kann\nobservieren. Das kann ich am besten. Schnell, lass uns zu unserem Hauptquartier\nzurückkehren und loslegen.\"",
      "_Seraphine_\n\nSie hatten mehrere Stunden lang Pläne geschmiedet. Seraphine war überrascht,\ndass Remy so gut darin war. Er hatte einen detaillierten Plan von mindestens der\nHälfte des Stockwerks gezeichnet und mit Katzentatzen-Symbolen markiert, wo die\ndrei Riesenfeinde normalerweise zu finden waren.\n\nLouis hingegen war der Logistikexperte. Er hatte alle Arten von Vorräten\nmitgebracht. Unter anderem hatte er ein kleines Notizbuch und eine kleine\nSpiegelscherbe dabei, mit der die Mäuse um Ecken blicken konnten.\n\nAber Sera brauchte nichts von alledem. Eigentlich konnte sie nicht einmal\nschreiben. Außerdem war nur sie selbst unsichtbar, nicht die Dinge, die sie bei\nsich trug. Es sah ziemlich eigenartig aus, als sie versuchte, als Unsichtbare\ndas Notizbuch mit sich zu tragen.\n\nSie beschlossen, Sera aus der Ferne zu beobachten, während sie die Katzen aus\nnächster Nähe ausspionieren konnte.\n\nNoch komischer als die Tatsache, dass sie sich nicht im Spiegel sehen konnte,\nwar der Gedanke, dass sie einfach auf die Katzen zugehen könnte, ohne dass diese\nsie bemerken würden. Das Wort, das sie suchte, war eigentlich nicht komisch,\nsondern beängstigend.\n\nAber sie musste es tun. Sie musste ihre Angst überwinden. Sie musste die Mutige\nim Team sein. Und so stand sie da, im Wohnzimmer der Villa, zwei Meter vom Kamin\nentfernt und nur einen halben Meter vor dem flauschigen, auf einem Teppich\nschlafenden Ungetüm. Ihr Herz klopfte so laut, dass sie Angst hatte, das\nKatzenmonster könnte es tatsächlich hören.\n\nSie stand mindestens eine Minute lang so da, bevor sie sich wieder zu bewegen\nwagte. Aber es schien zu funktionieren. Also traute sie sich ein bisschen mehr.\nZuerst nur ein paar Schritte, dann ein paar mehr, bis sie direkt vor dem\nriesigen geschlossenen Auge direkt neben dem Kopf des Monsters stand. Sie konnte\ndas flauschige Fell auf der Wange der Katze sehen. Dann machte sie einen Fehler.\nVersehentlich berührte sie einen der Schnurrhaare, und die Katze öffnete die\nAugen.\n\nSeraphine blickte direkt in die großen grünen Pupillen, die ihr wie riesige\nScheinwerfer vorkamen. Aber nichts geschah. Die Katze drehte ihren Kopf herum\nund setzte ihr Nickerchen fort. Das war der Moment, in dem sie wieder zu atmen\nbegann. Sie muss etwa eine Stunde lang die Luft angehalten haben. Aber in\nWirklichkeit dauerte alles nur ein paar Sekunden. Das erste Experiment war\nerfolgreich.\n\nAlso setzten die Wunderbaren Guillorys ihre Mission fort."

      "## Marla\n\nMarla Lay had been a gifted child. She graduated at age 13, got her master's\ndegree at 15 and wrote an already groundbreaking piece as her PhD Thesis when\nshe was 20. That was in the year 2089.\n\nBut it was not the end of her career. She was not obsessed with going deeper\ninto one field. She wanted to go broader. She wanted to have an explanation for\nthe universe as a whole. And some of her broad skills helped her in other\nsituations as well. She was the one exceptional multi talent of the third\nmillennium, thinking outside the box like her role model and genius of the\nsecond millennium, Albert Einstein.\n\nOne of her interests was in data science. She was working with AI in terms of\ntraining and giving them the right kind of work at the right time. It turned out\nto be some kind of symbiosis.\n\nHer second side trait was a good portion of realism and an understanding of\neconomy and psychology. So she also was a natural leader and entrepreneur.\n\nThe real breakthrough in her main field of work, physics, had happened at\nage 26. In 2095, she published her paper 'A Theory of Transspace', a paper that\nwas supposed to change the world of science and the world itself more radically\nthan the Theory of Relativity and Darwin's Origin of Species together.\n\nBut even that was just the start. Marla was supposed to become more famous than\nEinstein, not only because of her groundbreaking papers that changed physics.\nShe added her entrepreneurial spirit to her work as a physicist. This instinct\nled her to the decision to form a think tank to bring her scientific work to the\nnext level and into reality.\n\nIn that project, she gathered many other leading scientists and engineers\ntogether for some years to develop viable spin offs and ideas from her\nTransspace theory. The project was called \"Enclave\", because she brought\neveryone in there to collaborate closely and work in a gated and controlled\nenvironment. Neither speculations nor premature thoughts went out of that\ncircle.\n\nThe results were disruptive to say the least. The team presented a Faster Than\nLight drive that made humanity ready to conquer the solar system. As a side\nresult, they presented anti gravity technology that also changed the life on\nearth at once by providing safe and fast transportation and an infinite amount\nof new and spectacular tools.\n\nBut yet another step increased her fame after the Enclave project published\ntheir results and that is the fact that she made money out of her discoveries,\nso much that she became the third richest person in the solar system with her\nmegacorp Zodiac.\n\nAt that time there were already four other global players, who were not so\nglobal anymore. They made their money in space by mining asteroids, running\nspace station chains and controlled interplanetary transport. All of them were\neager to use the new tech, that could bring more people and goods to and from\ntheir real estate in a shorter time. But Marla and Zodiac owned many of the\npatents and had the talent and skills to use them. They were soon involved in\nall of these profitable businesses.\n\nEven the name was wisely chosen as two of the other corporations were called\nSagittarius and Scorpio. Zodiac for them might have sounded like a declaration\nof war. But at the same time, they needed access to that groundbreaking\ntechnology.\n\nFifty years later, Marla retired from the company's chair at age 80. The solar\nsystem was split between three corporations with more financial power than any\nstate on earth. The Dublin drive, invented by Zodiac, was the dominant spaceship\ntechnology. So the company became number two under Marla, so huge that it could\nbuy number three, Sagittarius. Bigger than any terrestrial nation, no authority\nwas there to prevent them from doing so. It was the corporate wild west. But the\npossibilities to grow didn't end at the borders of the solar system.\n\nAfter Marla Lay, Chi Feng became chairman. He came up with the idea to put his\nclaim on other star systems. He was a diplomat and cultivated good relations\nwith the other megacorps. He managed to form a consortium with his competitors.\nTheir project: sending a series discovery drones into the universe.\n\nAlready two years later, the first pair of drones launched from the facilities\nat Zodiac space station. Project Gemini - of course it was named after a zodiac\nsign and as it was a pair of rockets, the choice was obvious - started to Alpha\nCentauri and Barnard's Star. The drones were built to find habitable planets and\nvaluable asteroids autonomously and acted as communication phalanxes for the\nprobes they carried in their bodies.\n\n## Marie\n\nMarie approached Zodiac Station inside the most comfortable space vessel\npossible. It had two lounges with top class bar tenders for only a few\nexclusively selected people. Everything was posh. But Marie was used to\ntravelling this way.\n\nHer destination - the station - circled Titan, which circled Saturn, which in\nturn circled our Sun. That was what she thought sitting among the 15 other suits\nwho prepared for the docking maneuver at the end of their comfortable flight.\nAll of them, Marie included, were representatives of the wealthiest corporations\nof the solar system. This was the most exclusive funding event she ever\nattended.\n\nBefore she could finish her thought, the impressive station appeared on Titan's\nHorizon. It was huge and perfectly symmetrical. The famous space architect Zoe\nZass had designed it. Actually it was the first piece of space construction that\nwas designed and not only engineered. It was iconic although it was a gigantic\nwharf, and industrial site.\n\nOn both sides, you could see the half-finished ships, the twins from the Gemini\nproject. Their characteristic star form with five arms coming from the\nspecifications of the Dublin drive could be seen. The twins were already bigger\nthan the shuttle they were in. But they were not yet even half as big as they\nwould finally become - and not to forget the fact the fact that they were drones\nthat wouldn't even carry a living space crew.\n\nOn additional parallel platforms, the manufactories were assembled. They would\nbe put into the belly of the drone ships when the mission started. These engines\ncould produce arbitrary tools, probes, miners or other devices to explore the\ntarget solar system. They were little autonomous wharves themselves - so much\nmore than 3d printers. They could digest raw material like ore from remote\nasteroids and forge whatever was needed for the mission.\n\nMost of the technology of these manufactories came from Maries company\nForgeForce. It was not among the five largest corporations, but their CEO\ndecided to invest a great deal of company money into the Gemini adventure. It\nwas a risky move, but Marie, who had been appointed as the project lead, was\nsure that it would pay off hundredfold.\n\nForgeForce's technology was the missing link for colonisation. The company\nengineered blueprints for hundreds of essential appliances to colonize a new\nplanet whether it was habitable or not - or not yet. The manufactories could\nbuild reliable housing, energy cells as well as terraforming gear on a large\nscale.\n\nFor Marie, the presentation on this day was impressive. At that point, half of\nher company had been involved in the project already but the investor show and\nthe disclosure of their plans and mission goals was the last missing bit to\nconvince her boss. After contributing technology he also bought ten percent of\nthe project shares two years ahead of their first launch.",
      "Two and a half years later, Marie was the CFO of her company. ForgeForce went\nthrough rather tough times as most of their capital was in the Gemini project.\nBut the first two projects were over now. The general idea was to build a\ncontinuous program to explore the surrounding stars around our solar system,\nalways two at a time. While one misson was on its way the machines for the next\ntwin mission was about to be assembled.\n\nSo these days, numbers three and four were docked at the Zodiac station. The\nfirst twins were on their mission and had already reported a fifty per cent\nsuccess. Probe number one brought early amazing results from our nearest\nneighbour, Alpha Centauri. It was a relief for the mission management and\nespecially for Maries company.\n\nBarnard's Star, the second mission however, had a series of failures in its\ntransmission module and didn't deliver any results.\n\nMarie had reached her goal already. Almost nobody would have expected such a\ngood outcome anyway. Alpha Centauri became a gold mine and Marie in turn was\nappointed to CFO. ForceForge was given the licenses for the construction work\nand real estate management of the first extrasolar dwellings of mankind. It was\nthe start of an exclusive holiday and migration business, the best time to build\nhotels on Proxima Centauri 3.\n\nThe Twins project and Marie's involvement even continued after she became CFO.\nThe company decided to reinvest their profits continuously. Every six months,\nZodiac was ready with another pair of probes and sent them on their way to the\nstars in our neighbourhood. They visited twenty destinations within five years\nand almost each of them with at least a small financial success. Some companies\nprofited from mining, others started terraforming and creating settlements.\nDozens of adventurous communities wanted to start a new way of living and be the\nfounders of a fresh society on a new planet.\n\nForgeForce had the knowledge to build all necessary infrastructure and also made\na lot of money with licensing their technology to the new settlements.\n\nIn the sixth year, something big happened. One of the probes reported the\ndiscovery of intelligent life.\n\n## Martin\n\nMission 23 of the Gemini project targeted the Rana system. Rana was a star with\nabout 30 light years of distance from the sun. For a long time, it had been\nconsidered a rather uninteresting system. Some scientists have claimed that\nthere wouldn't be planets at all. Mission 18 however brought us closer and the\nGemini probe's manufactory had produced a large telescope that transmitted\nfootage from its host system, but also from surrounding stars. It became clear\nthat Rana showed thought-provoking anomalies.\n\nThe Gemini project had already found life on mission 12 and 17. It discovered\none planet with a fungi like species that rendered the planet pretty much\ninhabitable and thus useless, but yet interesting for scientists. The other one\nwas a planet with an almost breathable atmosphere and grass-like plants. It was\nthe most promising candidate for a short term terraforming project, that could\nproduce a second Earth within a century.\n\nBut Rana turned out to be different. When the Gemini probe approached the\nsystem, the first detailed stereoscopic screenings showed clear signs of life\nand activity. The Gemini headquarters on Earth immediately sent orders for\nvisual observation, so the probe started manufacturing a series of planetary\nmicro drones with hi-resolution optics.\n\nOne month into the project, the drones produced footage of the planet's surface.\nThere were settlements and humanoid lifeforms. The next step was immediately\nclear to everyone at the Gemini headquarters. A manned mission was planned.\n\nThe various wharves around Titan and in the Jupiter orbit had a lot of\nexperience in building bespoke space ships in a short amount of time. Within one\nyear they conceived and built an interstellar ship for a 100 people crew.\n\nThe Nigerian Martin Adebayo was a diplomat at Zodiac station at that time. He\nwas the representative for the United Nations and the African Union and\nresponsible for the relations with the Gemini project and in that role a core\npart of the Gemini supervisory board.\n\nFor his age, he was just thirty, he had already achieved a lot and was well\nknown amongst diplomatic circles and a valuable consultant for the project. It\nwas only natural that the organisers of the Rana mission asked him to join as\nlead diplomat.\n\nWhat that meant was not immediately clear to him at the moment they approached\nhim. Only in the night, when he was lying awake in his bed, he realised that\nthis meant something historic. He could be the first human to meet an alien,\nstanding in one line with Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, Jennifer\nWoo, the first woman on Mars and Mathieu Valinort, the first man on Proxima\nCentauri 3. After realising that, he could not sleep at all anymore that night.\nHe heard his heart beating for six hours, then he stood up, took a shower and\nsigned up for the job.\n\nThe staff selection for the Rana mission continued while the training for the\ncrew members that were already appointed started. Next to actual training\nsessions, Martin took part in strategy meetings together with some of the\nbrightest minds in philosophy and anthropology that could be found on Earth.\n\nThe whole crew of the mission consisted of sociologists, linguists, biologists,\nengineers and a handful of reporters next to the diplomatic corps of seven\npeople led by Martin.\n\nOn day zero, he stood in line with the others as Captain Persson gave her\ndeparture speech. Martin was a little nervous and very proud not only because of\nsuch an important mission he was sent to but also because hundreds of reporters\nand dozens of cameras transmitted these moments to over eight billion people who\nwatched the event in the live stream.\n\nBut there was still a lot to achieve until the actual first contact. So he\nquickly calmed down again and got himself distracted by the routines that\nfollowed. Only an hour later, the Captain gave the order for departure and the\nengines ignited. Another five minutes later, they passed into Transspace. The\n30-ly journey would take them one year, one year of further preparation on\nboard.\n\nMartin's crew and the other departments had a tight schedule. Physicists\nanalysed the available data from the probe's information stream from the Rana\nsystem. Martin's diplomats and negotiators went through all their strategies and\nworked together with the Sociologists on studies about settlements and derived\npotential social structures that could give them hints about the character of\ntheir aliens. For now, they called them 'the Rana'ans'.",
      "Arriving in the Rana system was less spectacular than Martin thought. The\nblackness of the space there followed the blackness between the systems. The\nonly difference was a star that shone a bit brighter than usual. They still had\ntwo days until they were supposed to reach the designated orbit.\n\nMartin also knew that it was not planned to meet the aliens directly after their\narrival. So even when they arrived, they had plenty of time to acclimatise and\nget acquainted to the situation. The plan was a detailed half-year observation\nmission before going into the next phase, the first contact. But at least,\narriving was a change for good for the surprisingly impatient diplomat.\n\nHe was not the mission lead, but in the council and so he had enough to do and\nenough to think during the two days of impatience. As soon as the ship reached\nthe orbit of Rana 3, Martin's mood immediately changed. His work mode switched\nfrom stand-by to alertness. He noticed that on the whole ship. Everyone woke up\nfrom inactivity as if they were kept in sleep chambers all the time like they\ndid in old sci-fi stories. Besides the rumors that spread in the canteen and the\nbar, also several work protocols seemed to autostart. The plans were detailed\nand so everyone on the ship including him and his team knew what to do.\n\nProbes were prepared. Camouflage surveillance drones were sent to the ground.\nTranslator systems were set up for learning mode. Science Teams started to make\ntheories. And Martin absorbed all the information for his first contact\nstrategy.\n\nThe following weeks brought an inflation of knowledge. The probes on the surface\nof Rana 3 worked perfectly. The translator AI learned the new languages within a\nweek. In the same week, the crew had already gathered a lot of geographical and\nsociological data. As soon as the translation matrix was ready for processing,\nthe working teams augmented their observations with spoken footage from the\naliens.\n\nMartin had learned the name 'Kret' for the first time two weeks after the\narrival. It was their name. That's how the aliens called themselves - the Kret.\nIt became an important milestone. Later on, Martin thought that it was the\nmoment where the Kret turned from an interesting phenomenon into his aliens, his\nlife project.\n\nMartin was concentrated, meticulous and became more and more obsessed with the\ndetails the found out about the Kret. Within three more weeks, he and his team\nhad learned a good deal about the Krets' history, preferences and habits.\n\nMost of the plan for the first contact had been worked out back on Earth\nalready, many philosophical and psychological principles were defined and a\nuniversal guide for meeting alien species for the first time was developed. But\nthe information that they collected now would be crucial for the choice of\nstrategy and the details of the first contact. It was his call to make.\n\nWhich landing place would they choose? Which people would they pick for\ninterviews? The things that mattered most was what he would say, what would be\nthe first words. A truly giant leap for mankind, but also for Martin himself.\n\nNow, a team of seven plus pilot and copilot were sitting in a shuttle waiting to\nbe transported to the first contact. Another phase of impatience started for\nMartin. Four of the crew were dressed like the Kret. They wore long robes and\nlightweight fabrics in natural colors with a lot of white and black. Martin had\nselected the tallest people in the whole crew, those who resembled the Kret\nmost, to act as pickers.\n\n\"Are you ready?\", repeated Martin impatiently. \"Let's go through the mission one\nlast time. Today, we pick the informers. These are the people close to the\nleaders we want to make contact with. Fortran, Alyssa, Peter and Renata, you\nknow the dossiers of your contact persons?\"\n\nA yes or a nod came from everyone.\n\n\"Good. Our Light Shuttles will bring yo to your destinations. You have twelve\nhours to make contact. Team two and myself will meet the other group of Kret,\nthe politicians. You know that we expect an outdoor gathering in three hours.\nThat is a unique opportunity. We must be there in time.\"\n\nThey had gone through that protocol dozens of times. So after the landing,\neverything went smoothly. Everyone of team one left for their solo mission. And\nnow team two and Martin observed, how their target group appeared at the\ndesignated place. It was time.\n\nAll of the monitoring systems reported a good safety level, so Martin dared to\nstep out of his hideout.\n\n\"Ashea, ashea\", he drew attention to himself by using the Kret language. He had\nlearned some words, but the translation engine would take over soon.\n\nThe group of seven Kret who had gathered here in a beautiful outdoor camp looked\nsurprised as they saw the alien. Martin had expected exactly that reaction.\n\n\"I am Martin Adebayo\", he said. \"I am here to meet you.\"",
      "On the inofficial day of first contact everything went according to plan. Team\none successfully made indirect contact with the planet's leaders and team two\nhad a good conversation with the group of Kret that had gathered in the camp.\nMartin was happy with the results. Especially there was no sign of aggression or\nfear. All Kret were very curious and open minded. Actually that was something\nthat made him think and later that week, he brought it up to the philosophers in\nthe crew for an interesting red wine discussion.\n\nNow it was time for the official first contact. The mission was about to meet\nthe leaders of Kret for the first time. The political system was significantly\ndifferent from earths countries and corporations model. The Kret lived in clans\nof 40 to 80 people. Most decisions were made inside those clan structures. Nine\nof those clans, however, were there to take the lead and coordinate higher level\ntopics.\n\nThe official first contact was supposed to be a formal event with around thirty\nselected crew members and the matriarchs and patriarachs of the nine clans. It\nwas a banquet in one of the most beautiful venues Martin has ever seen. The\nfood, that originally had been predicted as a potential blunder, was a safe bet\nafter the drones had analysed the kitchen and diet on Kret. But the actual meal\nwas not only acceptable. It was 'extraordinaire', as one of the French\ncrewmembers coined it. It turned out that almost everything the Kret crafted was\nsomehow brought to perfection.\n\nThe following months were the actual new ground. While every single minute until\nthe first contact was well planned by hundreds of experts, the time after that\nwas the challenge that Martin had been searching for. Working groups with\nmembers of the Kret and the Humans were founded to work on detailed exchange in\nthe fields of history, culture, science and technology.\n\nMartin finally became the first ambassador of Earth. He represented the whole\nplanet here on Kret, while at home, the nations and corporations were still in\npolitical, economic and physical war with each other. At the end of the mission,\nhe decided to take a permanent residence on Kret while most of the crew went\nback to earth. Also a permanent shuttle connection was established that brought\npeople from and to Kret once a month.\n\nOne evening, he and his friends, Kret and Humans alike were sitting together as\nthey often did and discussing topics from philosophy to daily business. Amanda,\nthe chief biologist of the crew usually joined as well, but today she and her\nteam worked longer.\n\nSuddenly she jumped into the room and shouted: \"You are no aliens!\" pointing at\nMesa and No'o, two of the Kret in the round.\n\nThey looked at each other. No'o was part of the grop of the first contact, one\nof the first to see Humans for the first time. And now he had the exact same\nsurprised facial expression as in that moment.\n\n\"Wait, what?\", asked Martin.\n\n\"We are related\", said Amanda. \"We are genetically related. We don't know every\ndetail yet. But we've found human DNA in your genome. Actually that shouldn't be\ntoo much of a surprise, right? I mean look at us. Martin, No'o your physiology\nis so similar.\"\n\n\"But how?\", asked No'o in only half of a sentence while his brain clearly needed\ntime to process.\n\n\"As I said, more details will follow. But we are pretty sure that the split is\naround 100.00 to 200.000 years old.\"\n\n\"But there were still Neanderthals on Earth at that time\", said Martin.\n\n\"Our history\", responded Mesa, \"goes back very long.\"\n\nThey continued discussing the topic for hours. Throughout the evening also the\nother biologists joined and shared more details.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was No'o who summarised the discovery perfectly.\n\n\"What do you think happened one hundred thousand years ago?\", he asked and the\nspeculations began.\n\n## Mesa\n\nMesa had an adventurous life. Her Arra, the clan she was born in, was one of the\nArram Mas. They were wealthy and influential in politics and large scale topics.\nIn her early twenties, before the humans came, she had the opportunity to be\nappointed into several councils that debated the present and future of the Kret.\nShe was a good speaker, listener and negotiator.\n\nWhen the humans came, she was lucky to be part of the group that made first\ncontact. She used this opportunity and kept contact, stayed open for\nopportunities and was one of the first Kret to learn the human language. But\nabove all, she was curious. She was eager to exploit the knowledge that\nnaturally comes when you make friends with a new species. A whole cornucopia of\nnew ideas and concepts was laid out in front of her.\n\nLater on she became a natural choice for the Hyperion project. Kret and Humans\nwanted to build the center of the Universe together, a space station almost\nexactly in the middle between the two home planets. The project was gigantic.\nThe Kret provided their craftsmanship and the Humans their technology and the\nmoney and resources of the mega corps.\n\nMega corps and capitalism overall were concepts that were hard to grasp for\nMesa. It took her almost a decade to understand the mechanics and subtle rules,\nschemes and conspiracies below the surface.\n\nNow she was standing in Hyperions great hall, a huge lobby with more than a\nhundred meteres of length and a large glass front. From many benches and\nlounges, you could look at the Keid star system. The planet they were orbiting\nwas Nava, named after the origin of everything in the Kret mythology.\n\nShe watched how the star Keid B was rising and immersed the thin atmosphere of\nNava into thousands of shades of red and orange. This event only happened about\nonce a week and the hall was full of spectators.\n\n\"There's a funny story about Keid\", said Rich, who stood behind her. Rich was\nher Human colleague and friend.\n\n\"Keid\", he continued in a mic drop way, \"is the sun of Vulcan.\"\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\", asked Mesa.\n\n\"Well there was an ancient story on earth, actually it was a famous show, that\nwas broadcasted. And it predicted the first contact with an alien species called\nthe Vulcans. And the planet Vulcan was placed here in the Keid system. At that\npoint, some 200 years ago, that was just a wild guess. We hadn't even discovered\nplanets on other star systems. But isn't that a coincidence? Us standing here\nnow looking at Vulcan.\"\n\n\"Well, if you say so\", said Mesa. \"I also have a story for you, Rich. You know\nabout transspace, right?\"\n\n\"Yea, who dosn't? I'm a scientist, of course I know Marla Lay. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Yesterday, I received some news from one of the collaboration teams, you\nremember them? They made a transspace discovery regarding time travel. It's just\ntheoretical stuff, but it made me think. What if time travelling was the reason\nfor us to exist? Some starship travels back 100.000 years and colonizes a\nplanet. And that little colony develops into us, the Kret?\"\n\n\"But then why don't you have all that technology?\", asked Rich. \"You Kret are\nvery sophisticated and educated, but you have a lack of at least three or four\ndisruptive tech discoveries. You should have had all of them from the beginning,\nright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right of course. I was just thinking.\"\n\nBut the topic continued bothering Mesa. She was not a scientist, but she treated\nthat topic in a scientific way. She became obsessed with it, but in a positive,\nnon-destructive way. After reading all available papers about it, she discussed\nthe matter in detail. First with her biologist friends, then with the physicists\nshe knew. And as a last step, she started publishing articles about it. At the\npeek of her obsession, she wrote the famous book \"3000 Generations of Humans\",\nwhere she enrolled all the details of her research and the progress that had\nbeen made in science since the topic started forming in her head.\n\n## Marisol\n\nThe year 2195 was a special year for Marisol. It was the 100th anniversary of\nthe transspace theory, that was sitting in the heart of her life - privately and\nprofessionally. Marisol was a physicist and worked as a navigator in the\nHyperion science fleet. She served on a ship called \"Kret 3\".\n\nThe science vessel was a rather large ship with more than 200 crew members\nconsisting of Kret and Humans alike. Marisol was from Earth, Madrid to be\nprecise. But she was at home in space. As the navigator, she knew all the stars\nby heart, but she was also very capable with the AI and the transspace\nalgorithms that were used to travel between them.\n\nAfter the Gemini missions had ended with mission 144, the known universe had\nbecome huge and the opportunities, especially for science projects were vast.\nBesides the main worlds, Earth, Kret, Proxima Centauri 3 and Hyperion, there\nwere 18 outposts, 40 space stations and four big terraforming projects ongoing.\nAll of them needed supplies of knowledge and technology.\n\nAdditionally there were countless missions into uncharted territories or\nunexploited resources like asteroid fields and gas clouds. The science fleet was\norganizing all that demand.\n\nDuring the celebrations of the anniversary, Marisol and the crew of Kret 3 were\non a mission to a micro black hole. One of the high res telescope arrays, that\nwere stationed on the outer borders of the known space had discovered this\nanomaly, that was about sixty lightyears away from earth.\n\nThe celebration ceremony was transmitted via ultra fast transspace arrays to all\nscience and engineering vessels of the fleet and the Kret 3 crew threw a big\nparty.\n\n\"I heard we've just arrived officially in the Nightshade system\", said Alex, one\nof the probe engineers to Marisol. The star system had been named after their\nmission, 'Nightshade', which was a great honour. Everyone wore their mission\nbadge with even more pride than usual.\n\n\"You're absolutely right\", answered Marisol with a glass of Spanish red wine in\nher hand. \"My calculations show that we crossed the Oort cloud of the star\nsystem about an hour ago.\"\n\n\"That's cool. So we arrive some hours ahead of time?\"\n\n\"No, not really. The captain gave out the strategy to be cautious with\napproaching the little black beast. So we will fall out of transspace sooner and\ntravel the rest of the way with normal speed. That will cost us three days.\"\n\n\"Oh I see. But also good, more time to recover from the party, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Haha\", laughed Marisol. \"Yes. But I don't know if we should overachieve on that\ngoal.\"\n\n26 hours later, this ship was scheduled to drop out of transspace. That was\nusually not a big event. But this time many interested scientists and engineers\ncame to the bridge to watch. Right after the drop, the high-res telescope\nphalanx would be focused on the black hole and everyone was eager to watch the\nfirst live footage of the anomaly.\n\n\"One minute to go\", announced Marisol in her role as the chief navigator.\n\n\"Everyone, prepare for a little shake\", said Captain Dars after some more\nseconds.\n\nThen the screen turned white and the ship went through some turbulences, more\nthan expected. Then the screen turned black and then white again. It was\nflickering.\n\n\"Gordon, what are we seeing here?\", asked the captain.\n\n\"Nothing\", answered the technician hesitantly. \"Sir, I don't know what else to\nsay. I see no error messages from the telescope feed. What we see is what the\ntelescope sees. I think\". The last part, the 'I think' was not very convincing\nit was more like a question, but to himself or rather the system he was\noperating on.\n\n\"That can't be\", said Dars. \"Drone C4 to the gazebo.\"\n\nThe gazebo was the go-to leisure spot on the ship. There was a bar, that served\nfood and drinks. But mainly it was famous for its large windows. The only real\nwindows on the ship.\n\nTwenty seconds later, the front screen of the bridge streamed the footage of the\ndrone. They saw the gazebo, but on the outside the sky turned black and white\njust like on the telescope feed before.\n\n\"No, that can't be\", repeated Dars. \"Marisol, what's going on? Where are we?\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't know. I've checked the navigation sensors. They don't catch any\nstars for calibration anymore. Even when the sky is not white, there are no\nvisible stars. So I can't say where we are. It must be the influence of the\nblack hole.\"\n\nIn the moment, she spoke it out, the shaking got stronger and the flickering of\nthe sky increased. Everyone on the bridge was trying to get a seat or at least a\ngrip on the wall. The first gravitation systems started beeping, which meant\nthat they could not balance out the external forces anymore. The ship was out of\ncontrol, while all the sensors showed Marisol that it was not moving at all.\n\nAnd then it stopped. No shaking, no flickering. The stars were back. Everything\nwent back to normal.\n\n\"Can I have some damage reports\", said Captain Dars immediately. \"Gordon,\nMarisol, what's up?\"\n\n\"It seems like the Dublin drive is broken\", said Gordon. \"I can't get it online\nanymore. It died. Ionic engines are running and electricity and life support\nwithin normal range.\"\n\nThe Dublin drive was the facility that created the tunnel into Transspace and\ntherefore the possibility to get home again. So the situation was concerning.\n\n\"How about the comms?\"\n\n\"Transspace Microtunnels for communication seem to be intact\", answered Gordon.\n\n\"OK. Fine. We're stranded, but we can contact the community. That's good.\nMarisol? Where are we exactly? Any surprises?\"\n\n\"I have bad news\", she answered. \"Look!\"\n\nShe pushed some buttons on her workstation and the feed she had seen also\nappeared on the big screen. It was labelled 'rear view' and it showed a planet\nfilling half of the screen that looked habitable.\n\n\"That is unexpected indeed\", said Dars. \"So what's this?\"\n\n\"That's the bad news. I don't know. I interpolated the navigation data and could\nnot identify our position.\"\n\n\"What exactly do you mean?\", he asked and added a command. \"Comupter, please\nshow us the front view again. Look at this. There's Orion down here. And the\nPlejadis.\"\n\n\"I know. But they look off, especially when you measure with nav precision.\"\n\n\"Kret\", said Fela looking into one of the side screens. She was one of the Kret\nscientists. \"This is Kret.\"\n\n\"Rear camera back on main screen\", said the captain. Dars was also a Kret, but\nthe Kret didn't grow up with aerial views of their planet. So he didn't notice\nin the few seconds, the planet had been on screen. But now, he clearly saw the\nsilhouettes of the continents.\n\n\"This is really bad news. So we're back at the start of or mission? Traveled\nthere within a minute. Who's joke is this? We are pranked, fellows.\"\n\n\"I don't think so\", said Marisol. \"Look at the C4 Drone. It clearly shows the\nplanet through the windows.\"\n\n\"Ok. Gordon, could you please open a channel to the headquarters? And the rest\nof us, we go to the gazebo.\"\n\nWhile Gordon typed and gestured busily on his workstation, the rest of the\ngroup, around twelve people including Marisol and the captain went to the\nGazebo. The view was beautiful as usual. A brightly shining planet, a red\nshimmer where night and day had met and a clear and starry sky. It was just not\nthe place they expected to be.\n\n\"Sir, I can't reach anyone\", said Gordon through the intercom. \"None from the\nheadquarters, none from Rana station or from the planet.\"\n\n\"But you said the comms were working\", said Dars and it looked like speaking to\nthe ceiling.\n\n\"Yes Sir, I double checked this as well. They are working. I just don't reach\nanybody.\"\n\n\"That can't be\", said Dars more to himself and then he went on to the group \"All\nright, back to the bridge. Everyone to their workplaces. Marisol, can you set a\ncourse to Rana Station, please? If they don't answer the phone, we have to pay a\nvisit.\"\n\nBack on the bridge, Marisol plotted the course by using the planet Kret and the\nsun Rana as navigation points because the stars were not a reliable source\nanymore. The ship ignited its ionic drive.\n\nFour hours later they appeared at the place where the station was supposed to\nbe. But it was not there. The station was gone.\n\n\"Sorry Sir\", said Marisol, \"I'm 99% sure that we are at the right place. I have\nno explanation for this.\"\n\n\"Hey all\", said Fela the Kret loudly to the whole room. \"Look at Kret. It's\ngreen and all looks right, but our city structures are not there. Here, west of\nthe mountains between the river deltas. There should be housings of a million\narras or more. That is where I come from. But where is it?\"\n\n\"Oh no\", said Marisol, \"oh no. Do you know the book '3000 Generations of\nHumans'?\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that book\", said Dars. \"It's a classic. What do you want to\nsay?\"\n\n\"Wait, let me check something. You might not want to hear that.\"\n\nShe turned to her workstation and let the AI run a quick simulation. Then her\nface turned from a glimpse of approving pride to a deep frown.\n\n\"You remember that I told you, the stars are off, right?\", the others nodded\nwaiting for the punch line. \"They are not. They are absolutely correct. But it's\nnot the stars of the year 2195.\n\nThe closer star constellations are off by some arc seconds only. Everything\npoints to constellations how they existed 100.000 years ago.\n\nWe ask ourselves why there is no space station? Well, because it does not yet\nexist. We ask ourselves why there is no visible city structure on Kret? That's\nbecause the Kret don't even exist yet.\n\nAnd If I may have a guess, then that we are ... this crew is the origin of the\nKret. We are the first humans that colonized or better will colonize this\nplanet. We are the first of the 3000 generations in Mesas famous book that will\nfollow.\""

As he didn't talk much, no one of the regulars in the\npub knew his story. He was a Japanese seaman and somehow, probably because of a\nwoman, landed in the biggest port of England.\n\nWhen the talks on the main table, where the regulars were sitting day-in and\nday-out, circled around seaside tales, he sometimes contributed a sentence or\ntwo. But never much.\n\nOne day, someone on the table again started a topic about the seaside. He began\na wild story about some hearsay monsters that appeared to medieval seafarers.\n\nSuddenly, Mr. Hanako stood up and said \"Do you want to hear a real story? I'm\nready to tell you mine ...\".\n\nThe whole pub fell silent.

The sea was as flat as a mirror and I was about to\nclean the middle deck. I looked up and saw that beautiful guy landing on the\nroof of the bridge. It was a perfect animal as it spread its wings.

Others would say that she's an\ninfluencer because, besides her job, she maintains a travel blog. Not for the\nwonders of the real world. She's travelling the Mesh.\n\nHer travelling avatar is special, too. She has designed it herself from scratch,\nwhich is very unusual these days. When travelling, she is a cyborg mixing\ncybernetic applications with human body parts. Her face is alomst her real one\nthough.\n\nIn the vast deeps of the mesh, you'll find a lot of famous architectural\nmasterpieces and 3d worlds to dive into and get lost in. But today, it's finally\ntime to visit **Prunus Digitalis**, the tree of digital life. It's just a cherry\ntree, but it is supposed to have thousands of easter eggs to discover.\nEspecially today.",

It was made out of wood and many rusty tools\nand instruments hang on the walls.\n\nAfter stepping out of that garage, she was a bit disappointed. There was no\ntree. Just high grass till the horizon with some coloured sprinkles of flowers\nin it. On the other side of the area, some 40 u away she saw another shed. It\nlooked like an exact copy. She walked there and saw the sign of a cicada on the\ndoor.\n\nShe went in and found herself in a different world. Lucy stood on the same grass\nplain. But here, she saw a different sky, that looked much more real than the\nusual Mesh projections. Somewhere in the distance, she saw the majestic tree\nrising in the middle of the green sea of grass.\n\nShe started walking and with every step, she saw more details and the tree grew\nbigger and bigger. Twigs were dynamically moving on the top of the crown and the\nleaves seemed to change colour from time to time creating a magical shimmer\neffect.\n\nWhen she entered the shadowed space below the tree, still many steps away from\nthe trunk, she stopped for a moment and listened to the sound of the wind\nblowing through the leaves.\n\n\"How can someone create such a beautiful piece of art?\", she thought. It was the\nmost perfect Mesh diorama, she had ever seen.\n\nThen she went on to the trunk that was as wide as a house and began to climb the\ntree of life.\n\nThe tree was not hard to climb. Its bark texture was rough and she found grip\nvery easily. Still, it took a while and a short moment of vertigo until Lucy\nreached the first branches of the crown that spanned above her like a giant\nneo-gothic dome.

Was this some shooter\ngame where she came without a weapon?\n\nBut the cat moved on. Strode past her with a proud look in its eyes and gave her\na slight touch along the way. She continued her climb.\n\nAbout a storey away, she caught a glimpse beyond the leaves of the tree into the\nsky. It turned into a dark grey and it began to rain slightly.

She found herself back in the tree.\nShe could go forward and backwards in time and watch herself explore the digital\nwonder from every angle. But she never managed to copy any content out of it."

      "The concert hall was disappointing as usual, an old shabby place made out of\nconcrete and ugly steel bars in the middle of nowhere south of Hamburg. But\nanyway Hugo loved live concerts. In the three-dimensional Mesh versions, you\ncould take a view from each angle, always experience perfect sound and see the\nmasterfully designed virtual architecture of the venue. But the connection to\nthe band was missing.\n\nThese days you usually got two or three tickets to virtual concerts of the tour\ntogether with your live ticket. Today, he went there alone. But his girlfriend\nAdele and his colleague `R00t` (he didn't even know her real name) were there,\ntoo. Both plugged in from home and connected through their immersives.\n\nHugo was a freelance operator and designer. He created and maintained places in\nthe Mesh, usually for companies. `R00t` was his developer. She was responsible\nfor the core software parts. They met each day. But they had never seen each\nother in real life.\n\nThe gig had been awesome as expected. But he went home in time, no more\nexcursions into after-concert clubs today. His home was in what the city knew as\nthe left pylon. The pylons had been a hotel project that didn't work out as\nexpected. The rooms and floors were built into the remains of the once famous,\nhuge Köhlbrand-Bridge in the harbour.\n\nThe original project had been very ambitious - several storeys of an exclusive\nhotel built into the two massive pylons and connected via gondolas. However, the\ncontractor company got bankrupt and left the construction site unfinished.\n\nBut the squatter community was strong at that time and so the venue got\ninhabited illegally. The infrastructure was excellent as soon as some geeks\nadded some DIY effort and maintenance. Nobody asked questions as long as the\nownership was not clear.\n\nAround 20 people lived on Hugo's side. But that day when he came home, he saw\nsomeone leaving through the elevator, someone he didn't recognize. It was\nsuspicious. When he entered his flat and noticed that he had been robbed, the\nshock therefore was not as heavy as one would think. Hugo had expected something\nlike that already.",
      "Zizkov was a rather strange place to live these days. But Hana liked the\natmosphere, which spanned between the cosy, old and worn down artist houses and\nthe rotten monster of concrete, the tower that once was used for TV\ntransmission. She bet that no one in Prague even knew anymore what a TV was. She\nalso only knew it from her stubborn grandparents who refused to use the Mesh.\n\nShe was sitting in the Bar Bukowski, her living room, the nicest place on earth.\nHer lenses were in AR mode so she could breathe its atmosphere while thinking\nabout her complicated second life as `R00t`.\n\n`R00t`, the hacker was not complicated at all. What gave her a headache was her\nrelationship with two people at the same time. She loved `B055`, but she also\nworked with him every day, so she couldn't tell him. But she also loved Adele,\nhis girlfriend. And she never met anyone of them in real life. A triangle of\ntragedies. If everything could be as easy and clear as coding, she thought.",
      "Hugo immediately looked through his things. What had been missing? What did that\nguy steal? All he possessed, everything of value was virtual. The Mesh was his\nhome. This flat was just a necessity.\n\nSo he started cleaning up the mess. The single room was not very big, so it was\neasy for the thief to mess up literally everything. Hugo folded his clothes that\nwere lying on the floor. He put back the three physical books he possessed -\namong them his only piece of sentimental value. \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", a\ngift from his mother. Then he put the tin plates and metal cups back into the\nkitchen corner.\n\nNothing was broken, nothing was missing. So what was this all about? At least\none thing was clear. He had to invest some bucks into security equipment. First\nthing tomorrow.\n\nHe sat on his chair and finally plugged into the mesh. In his home space on his\nvirtual desk, a light was blinking on the old, virtual fifties office telephone.\nA message. From local. The thief must have planted it.",
      "\"She's gone. They have her. What should I do? This is so fucked up. What's going\non?\" `B055` had a complete breakdown. He had called Hana into their office space\nin the Mesh and didn't stop talking nonsense since she had arrived. She still\ncouldn't understand a word. He needed a slap in his digital face.\n\nShe opened the console and typed. Then a noise was induced into `B055`'s ears.\nAfter a short gesture of horror, his voice stopped and he started breathing\nheavily.\n\n\"`B055`, hey\", she adressed him. \"What is going on? Talk slowly and in full\nsentences!\"\n\nAfter some more seconds of breathing, he finally started. \"Someone has kidnapped\nAdele. They broke into my flat and left me a message.\"\n\nNow Hana broke down as well, but she had to keep the rollercoaster on the\ninside.\n\n\"Who are they? What do they want?\", she asked.\n\n\"I don't know who. They come back with more. They left me the coordinates of a\nmessage box. Adele is off the grid, `R00t`. She's not traceable and I can't\nreach her.\"",
      "\"Glad you have found our message\", a distorted voice said with a noticeable\nironic undertone. \"We have your girlfriend. You know that. Hugo Niemann, you\nwill do something for us. You will raid the crypto vault of Credit Cayman. We\nknow what you're capable of.\"\n\n\"That is what they sent me\", said `B055` to `R00t` in their virtual home base\nafter he had calmed down a bit and came back from visiting and looting the given\ncoordinates. \"They also gave me some additional instructions in an encrypted\nattachment. Probably the first picking test.\"\n\n\"We're not criminals\", answered `R00t` in a slight panic. \"At least not that\ntype. But Adele, she's in danger and I'm sure they'll finish her if we involve\nthe cops.\"\n\n\"We can't go to the cops. That would be the end of our work and my home in the\nPylons. We have to do it.\"\n\n\"You're right. I'm frightened, but I'm also pissed. Hugo, we have to do\nsomething. We're better than this.\"\n\n\"What do you have in mind?\" asked `B055` finally.",
      "`B055` once showed her the place in the 3D map of Prague. \"I'd go there\", he\nsaid pointing at the ugliest piece of brutalism architecture that her otherwise\nbeautiful home city had to offer. It was the abandoned, rotten TV tower. Now she\ncame here to think from time to time. And there was a lot to process now.\n\nShe thought of the heist. Why them? How should they do it? She also had to think\nof beautiful Adele. Was she safe? And she had to think of `B055`, who was no\nboss at all. She now found out about his real name, Hugo Niemann. Well, it\ndidn't make things less complicated in her head.\n\n\"Focus\", she thought while sitting in the wind on a concrete plateau 100m above\nthe red roofs. She went through the heist, every step, looked up things through\nher AR, created small programs, helper dæmons and illegal bridges to quantum\ncomputing arrays.\n\nThen she saw something in the virtual blueprints. She found their way out of\nthis mess. Now there was one question left: Should she tell `B055`?",
      "The day of the heist. `B055` and `R00t` prepared themselves. They chose flies as\ntheir Avatars. `R00t` once came up with that mod. Actually, avatars have to be\nat least 1 unit in height, about 1 meter in real life, but she found a creative\nway around this rule. For today's purpose, a little piece of nothing that could\ndefy virtual gravity was a perfect fit.\n\nSecurity in the Mesh is a two-fold topic. There are the virtual mechanics in\nplace, a set of rules that define the physics of the system. A wall simply can't\nbe passed easily and all objects have a protocoled relation between each other.\nA user can't mess up with those things that easily on the code level for\nexample. This first aspects provides a significant level of security already.\nImportant stuff, however, is additionally secured by crypto, the very valuable\nassets were encrypted on quantum computing level.\n\nThe Credit Cayman vault had both. But as flies, most of the mechanical\nobstacles, entrance, elevators, door locks, were not really an obstacle. All the\nothers were a task for `R00t`'s AI, that she called Kit. `R00t` Kit, a funny pun\nonly she and a handful of really old hackers understood.\n\nOnly minutes later they surpassed the physical security layers and stood in\nfront of the safe, back in their normal avatars.",
      "The safe was a different beast. It couldn't be cracked with programming skills.\nThat was the task of `B055`, the Operator. Hugo did not only know most of the\nsecurity systems by heart, he also had an intuition for the situation and he had\na bespoke toolkit from `R00t`. So he went to work.\n\nThere was a scanner that searched the whole vault for intrusive objects, but it\ntook minutes to complete, so they had a window.\n\nThe first five levels of crypto security. That was an only mildly complicated\npart, simple enough for a digital lockpicker expert. He established a bypass\nconnection to one of the quantum computing arrays that `R00t` organized for him\nand within seconds, these front doors were unlocked.\n\nBut there was more. For two virtu-physical locks, he could use a tool similar to\nan endoscope for digital rooms. He looked directly into the mechanics and solved\nyet another of the riddles within seconds.\n\nFinally the detector traps. Even being a fly didn't help with that problem. They\nhad to find the target and replace it before the scan completed. It took awfully\nlong. The scanner would soon detect them. Hugo's clock showed 30 seconds when\nthey opened the door to the inner chamber.\n\n`B055` had moved like a robot. This was his world, the crunch time. Twenty\nseconds left on the clock. The time was counting down in his heads-up display.\nFor some of the data artefacts, he used ejectors that could transfer the raw\ndata. But some of them had to be extracted as a whole, the complete virtual\nobjects. The problem: This would be discovered within minutes by the securities\nat Credit Cayman.\n\nIn parallel `R00t` therefore had to take care of covering their traces. She\nscrambled transmissions and dynamically switched VPN chains.\n\nAnd on top, she planted the evidence, their counter heist. It would be a digital\nbomb that was supposed to detonate six hours later. She placed data packages,\nthat contained backtraces to their imposed clients, in carefully selected areas\nof the virtual vault. A risky manoeuvre. That's why she didn't tell `B055`.\n\nFive seconds left.\n\n\"Allright, let's go\", he said and finished the last step. Then they activated\nHoudini, the Software that made Avatars disappear.",
      "`B055` and `R00t` needed over three hours in their virtual lab to sort out and\nprepare the loot from the heist. Some of the data packets contained encrypted\ninclusions they had to crack first. Some others were still covered in their\nvirtual objects. Paranoid shit.\n\nBut finally, they could put their delivery together. They still had no idea what\nit was. The data didn't make any sense to them. It was no crypto money. That's\nthe only thing they knew. Finally, `B055` pushed the button and sent off the\ndata to the classic email account the kidnappers gave them.\n\nTime was ticking while they waited. `R00t`'s virtual bomb that placed the\nevidence was time-based and supposed to detonate in some minutes. After that,\nthey might have had another hour until the bank got hold of their kidnappers.\nShe repeatedly looked at the countdown on her watch. Time passed. The bomb went\noff and `R00t`'s stood still for a while. It didn't work, did it?\n\nA minute later, `B055` received a simple message with a green checkmark emoji\nfrom an unknown number. Another five minutes later, he heard from Adele.",
      "Three weeks had passed since the heist. Although the first call with Hugo and\nAdele was heartwarming and tears were flowing, Hana felt a change. They barely\nhad gigs together in that time and they met in their real Avatars. At the same\ntime, they were closer and more distant to each other. Hana decided that it was\ntime to do something. She took the train to Hamburg.\n\nShe crushed somewhere in the pylons in one of the abandoned rooms near Hugo's\nplace. On the second night, she sat in a bar with him.\n\n\"Adele did not take it so well\", he started the conversation. \"Last week, we\nbroke up.\"\n\nHana was devastated. \"Why didn't you tell me? Should I go and talk to her?\"\n\n\"I think, you should give her some time.\"\n\nThey didn't say much more that night, just sitting in front of their cocktails\nand staring at the opposite wall.\n\nBut Hana had to try. On the next morning, she visited Adele and had a long talk.\nAdele wasn't used to that kind of crazyness. She wasn't made for risky actions\non the verge of legality. She wasn't made for their life.\n\nIn that moment, also Hana recognized that it takes a while to heal the wounds\nand took the next train back to Prague."

      "I'm a developer and computer guy, so it's only natural that the most fascinating\ngenre in science fiction for me is Cyberpunk. My favourite novel - hereby\nrecommended - is Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\".\n\nThe coolest part in this type of story always was the 3D version of the internet\nin there - like the \"metaverse\" but much cooler, darker and also filthier. Just\nlike the real internet was before it was dominated by 5 mega sites.\n\nWe're still not there - nothing is 3D. Nobody (including Zuck) has even shown\noff a realistic concept. We might be right ahead of a big shift in that\ndirection. I'm waiting for those apple ski goggles to become useful. But for\nnow, it's still imagination.\n\nMy imagined version of a Cyberpunk internet (starting after I had read Snow\nCrash and Neuromancer in 1992) is called \"**The Mesh**\" and throughout the\ncourse of this small essay, I show off some of its details.\n\n## Geometry\n\nThe virtual world is a giant torus with exactly the same surface as the earth.\nThe measuring is decimal and uses units (**u**) which are equivalent to 1 meter\nand klicks (**k**) for kilometres.\n\nThe form factor of the torus is **7**. So the tube ends up with a radius of\n**929 k** and the inner radius (the hole) is **6504 k**.\n\nThe tube is split into 512 sectors, which results in a width of **11,4 k** per\nsector. The torus has 4.096 sectors. Therefore on the outside equator, the\nsectors are nearly squares.\n\nSectors have a unique address written as `@ttt.TTT`. `ttt` represents the tube\nsegment in octal (as lower case letters `a..h`). `TTT` represents the torus\nsegment in hexadecimal (as numbers and uppercase letters `0..9A..F`). Valid\naddresses look like this: `@had.14D`. You can imagine what the tube segment\n`@bad` has to offer, right?\n\nNow let's zoom in a bit more into my very own metaverse clone. We've learned\nthat one sector has a length of 11.4 k. This area again is split into 256 x 256\nso-called **areas**. Each around 44 x 44 u (meters) in size (a bit less on the\ninside of the torus as mentioned). With that addition, the formal addresses are\ncomplete. Four additional hex digits now form the full location like\n`@had.14D.00.1a`.\n\nJust like today's IP addresses, these formal ones may have easy-to-remember\naliases. The most well-known one is surely `@root`, the global main entrance to\nthe mesh welcoming all newbies.\n\nEach area is hosted on a dedicated server or cloud space including all its 3d\ninformation. Unmaintained or better unclaimed areas are forwarded to a generic\nlandscape generating server. Whenever your avatar moves around in the mesh, it\nis located in one of the areas.\n\nThere is only one contract between areas. **6 u** (units) in the exact middle of\neach side of a square have to stay open to be able to move from one area to the\nnext. That's where usually streets go through.\n\n## Moving in the Mesh\n\nAs mentioned, an avatar can travel between two areas by stepping over the 6 u\nwide gap in the middle of each side of the area square. This happens more or\nless without noticing.\n\nBut there is another way of reaching a certain area. You don't have to walk\naround the whole world to reach a certain place. Every area is filled with\nstreets and buildings and public art and lights etc. One of these constructs is\na portal. Each area has exactly one of them. The owner of the area is\nresponsible for the look of that portal but there has to be one and it follows\nsome rules.\n\nIt's always a door - minimum 2 u high and 1 u wide. It is placed anywhere in the\narea. And in eye height at 1.5 u there has to be a well-visible standardised\nportal sign. Other than that, portals are creative spaces for their architects.\nSome just resemble backdoors or weird standalone objects, others are landmarks\nlike the pyramids.\n\nYou can step through the portal and then choose your destination and travel to\nthe other side of the doughnut in an instant.\n\nSpeaking of Avatars. After the first exercises, where test users had been given\nthe ability to design their own characters, it turned out that people tended to\nexperiment. Some of them created disproportionally huge or much too small\navatars.\n\nAfter that, the designers of the mesh added restrictions. An Avatar, which is\nthe representation of a user in the Mesh must be between 1 u and 2 u in height\nand a maximum of 1 u in width and depth. The minimal portal sizes are based on\nthese values.\n\nUp to today, these are the only restrictions. If you walk along the streets of\nthe more crowded areas, you see many different characters ranging from\nphotorealistic to exotically fluffy. Most people even have several avatars they\ncan choose from when entering the Mesh. One of the photorealistic types is\nusually always in the portfolio.\n\nClothing is a big topic as well and because you can already express a lot of\nindividuality with it, the realistic avatar is being picked 19 out of 20 times.\n\nThe Mesh has four attraction points on its outer equator - South, West, North\nand East. The southern centre is `@root`, the default entry point if you log\ninto the Mesh. It is therefore the largest travelling hub. Most people enter\nhere just to directly transit through its portal to other destinations.\n\nBut there are also quite some attractions located around that spot - mainly for\nthe newbies and occasional surfers.\n\nIf you visit the mesh often - and that is the majority of over a billion users -\nyou most likely have a home base. This is a flat, an apartment or your own house\nbuilt somewhere in the vast regions of the mesh space. In case you have that,\nyou always respawn in there after a new login.\n\nFor most people, the home base has much more functions than only an access\npoint. It's a central message hub and often has facilities to control other\nthings inside or outside the mesh from setting the indoor temperature in your\nreal flat at home to organising your week. It is like a mixture between the old\ndesktop screen on a two-dimensional computer and a personal assistant.\n\n## Coding\n\nWhen the Mesh and its predecessors had been introduced, the way how content was\ncreated changed drastically. Before that, the web had consisted of semantic\ntext, most of the time dynamically controlled by software that ran on servers or\nin a browser.\n\nWith the introduction of three-dimensional virtual realities, developers also\nhad to consider the space and the representation of their data in it.\n\nThe Mesh is still an open, decentral net. To allow a homogenous virtual\nimpression of such a heterogeneous situation, the managing consortium introduced\na development standard called UNO, **Unified Net Objects**.\n\nThis standard splits the 3d world into a huge tree of nodes that permanently\nchange. Each node in there is represented by three characteristics:\n\n- its **look and feel** including its relation to its children and parent nodes\n- the **data** that it stores\n- and the possibilities of how it could **interact** with data and environment\n  aka. the code.\n\nWriting programs for the Mesh is more complicated and fuzzy than in previous\nversions of the internet.\n\nIn former times, coding was precise. A developer controlled every single pixel\nand every interaction. But the surface of a 3D world is much bigger than a web\nbrowser's interface. The Mesh can be entered with devices from watches to\nimmersive suits. Each of them comes with different ways of dealing with the Mesh\nspace.\n\nTherefore a good part of the interaction between different objects in the Mesh\nis controlled by the Mesh's core software itself. Developers could do, but\nrarely do detailed motion studies to tweak micro movement curves of objects.\nThese days, that is the realm of AI. Aspects like facial expressions or body\ngestures are derived from live or trained video footage and applied by an\nartificial intelligence algorithm.\n\nDevelopers and designers are plumbing the pieces together. Additionally, there\nare huge libraries of basics to choose from. Devs can concentrate on the 20%\nthat make the difference. And the stars among them can do real magic with it.\n\n## Structure and Texture\n\nWe already know that the Mesh is a giant doughnut, But I want to give you some\nmore details.\n\nThe Builders wanted to introduce as many different sceneries as possible. That\nis why they chose the for of a torus. The doughnut is rotating around one axis\nin a daily cycle and around the symmetrical centre in a yearly cycle and it's\nilluminated by a giant sun from one side. This creates the effect of day and\nnight and sometimes even a tube eclipse. Then the shadow of one tube side casts\na shadow on some areas on the other side.\n\nIn addition, the torus has four spokes on the inside and in the centre of it\nall, there is a spherical core. The spokes are small compared to the diameter of\nthe doughnut tube but gigantic when you stand right in front of one of the\nsockets. All of this central construction contains the management and\ncontrolling facilities to run the mesh - from teleportation logic to search\nengines. Companies who build infrastructure to run the mesh have their home turf\ninside a spoke or even in the core sphere.\n\nThe freshly created pristine Mesh contained virtual landscapes that resembled\ndifferent regions of the earth from Antarctica over deserts to rainforests.\n\nThere is one unifying element, a gigantic river called **Lethe** that spans the\nwhole outside equator of the Mesh doughnut. The river is in some areas as wide\nas an ocean but in other areas as small as 10u.\n\nBesides that, you can find wide land, hills and mountains, forests and other\nrivers and lakes all of which in the end lead into the Lethe.\n\nIn the first year, the Mesh was exclusively opened for designers, architects and\ncompanies in a closed Beta. They started to terraform the surface. They created\ncities, they designed geometric structures, organic streets, artificial\nmonuments and re-formed some of the landscapes to make them even more\ninteresting.\n\nThey also became the owners of the first claimed areas. They defined the first\nlook of a world that was meant to be changing over and over from that point\nonwards.\n\n## Architecture and Interior\n\nArchitecture in the Mesh Cyberspace is an essential ingredient. It has become\nthe most admired discipline amongst designers and produced buildings and cities\nas diverse as the real world and beyond.\n\nIn theory, buildings are logistically restricted to an area (you remember?\nThat's around 44 x 44 u) and have a maximum height of 200 u to avoid superlative\neffects. Only towards the largest spokes of the doughnut wheel, higher\nskyscrapers up to 1.000 u are allowed to compete with the gigantic column that\nspans into a seemingly infinite sky. And don't forget that streets have to go\nthrough the middle of the area borders. Within the boundaries of these\nparameters, the owner of an area has absolute freedom to build whatever they\nwant.\n\nSome designers have found ways to overcome these limits with tricks and\nexceptional rules. For example, there are 6 beautiful sports stadiums that span\n3 x 4 areas (170 x 130 u) consisting of 12 distinct buildings. If you look at\ntheir construction in detail, you'd still see the rules applied. But for most\npeople, they look like a homogenous whole.\n\nThe mesh is a dynamic model. A renderer only loads what it currently needs. On\nthe outside, this divides the world into areas. But the inside of buildings is\nonly loaded when your avatar enters them.\n\nThere are no physical rules for the geometry of building interiors. The geometry\ndoesn't even have to fit its outer size. As a designer, you could build a small\nSwedish cabin by a lake and make the inside a huge warehouse for space rockets.\n\nOn the other hand, some views on the torus are so spectacular, that you want to\nprovide windows to look outside. The best example is one of the high towers next\nto one of the giant spokes of the torus construct. At 1.000 u height, you can\noversee the whole curving with the city structures and the far-out landscapes\nbelow.\n\nThe architectural design - interior like exterior - is therefore an art form in\nitself. Just like in the real world it spans from profane and off-the-shelf to\nmasterfully crafted and genius. And it changes its form every day.\n\n## The Train\n\nThe train is probably the most iconic attraction on the Mesh. Technically,\nnobody needs a transportation facility in the virtual world. Just go to the next\nteleporter, pick your target area and there you are. The train has a different\npurpose, however.\n\nIts monorail is precisely spanning the outer equator. It is built at a height of\n500 u, way above the height of buildings. The rail is constructed as a\ntransparent tube and the trains wagons are also equipped with generously huge\nwindows. The sight if you sit in there takes your breath away. This is a trip\neveryone should do from time to time.\n\nEvery 16 sectors, there is a stop. The 256 iconic train stations are the only\nexceptions to the 200u rule mentioned before. They are designed by the best\narchitects. The northern, eastern, southern and western stations are the most\nwell known buildings in the virtual world. The `@root` travelling hub on the\nsouth pole, where the majestic train station and the main entry into the VR fall\ntogether, is the epicentre of the whole Mesh.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI got started with the concept of the Mesh back in the late eighties when I had\nread Neuromancer. So it was way before Zuckerberg's Metaverse and the modern\nworld that is on the brink of introducing Augmented Reality to our everyday\nlife. But one part is missing to becoming Cyberpunk: the real world.\n\nCyberpunk is a melange combining virtual worlds with a most often dystopian\nfuture. But there is no easy way to include the real world in a world-building\nconcept. As an author and inventor of stories, you have to feel it. You have to\nre-live future world scenes in your head. Everything must come to life.\n\nYou might have already read the first part of the first storylines playing with\nthe Mesh. I've also dedicated the story of my left arm's tattoo motives to this\nuniverse. Expect much more where this comes from. I have so much fun writing\nthis.\n\nWorld-building is not only a necessary tool for consistency. It's a source of\nideas. I hope you've enjoyed it."

      "Aliens have always been the icing on the science fiction cake.\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I started imagining extraterrestrial worlds, partly to\nunderstand our own world better. I called my first alien race \"**The Kret**\".\nThe world building went deep into details at that time and micro stories spun of\nalready during their creation. Watch out for the next weeks and editions for\nsome of them.\n\nThe Kret have a lot of similarities with humans. Reasonable explanations will be\nprovided for that aspect. I'm already stuck in the middle a short story about\nits circumstances. However, their society and existence differ drastically from\nours. The reason for it is that I wanted to find out more about our own society\nby creating a slightly different model of life. But let's go through the bare\nfacts first.\n\nThe alien population lives on an earth-like planet called Kret. Kret is orbiting\nthe star Rana or Delta Eridani within its habitable zone. Rana is about 30 Ly\naway from earth. My choice for that system took me weeks at that time (1990s).\nIt involved going through hundreds of stars nearby and even making an attempt t\ndraw them int a 3D model. On paper. It was pre-internet and especially before\nthe discovery of exoplanets. Today, we have proof of thousands of planets in\nalmost every star system, but unfortunately not in that one. It probably was a\nbadly educated guess at that time.\n\nHowever, as many fact are based on the location and distance of that star system\nand because I still like the name Rana, I will stick to it. Probably in some\nyears, an advanced satellite finds a hint of exoplanets in that system, too.\n\n## The Planet\n\nBut back to the story. The planet **Kret** is slightly smaller than Earth. Also,\nits gravity is lower. That's why the average Kret is a bit taller than humans -\naround 1,90 for female and 1,95 for male Kret.\n\nThe surface of the planet consists of 75% ocean. The remaining 25% form a\nsingle, contiguous continent. The Kret almost entirely live along the west coast\nin front of a large, long mountain chain, that spans the coast from north west\nto south east. There are only a handful of settlements on the other side of the\ncontinent.\n\nThe mountain range is the source of many big rivers, that flow into the sea\nafter going through five vast deltas. Most of the 200 million inhabitants live\nin that region forming communities from smaller settlements up to larger\ncity-esque areas.\n\nAll river systems are connected through artificial channels with each other and\nform a widespread system of river bound transport ways that made the Kret\nsociety prosper.\n\n## The Kret Themselves\n\nAs mentioned, the Kret are astonishingly (or let's say suspiciously) similar to\nus humans. They could even walk through Stockholm or Hamburg without being\nnoticed. This is a fact that no expert in Xenology would have predicted before.\nAs said they are a bit taller, which can be explained and their look resembles a\nmixture of various terrestrial regions, black, white asian and a touch of native\namerican, some leaning more or less to one or the other.\n\nAfter the first contact, scientists were able to dive deeper into that\nphenomenon and found similar DNA, but encountered a deviation in the genetic\nlines that suspiciously date back to about 100,000 years. All differences can be\nexplained by the different environments and a small original genetic pool.\n\nOn the planet, they found terrestrial genetic profiles based on DNA in plants\nand animals, but they also came across a second line of plant-like structures\nwith very unique, non-DNA based biology.\n\nThe social environment of the Kret shows one characteristic difference from us.\nThey live in clans called \"**Arras**\". Arras are their only social grouping.\nThey don't have countries or borders, they don't have the concept of cities as\nwe know them.\n\nThese clans are comparable to large families of 30 to 70 members. The Kret in an\nArra are not necessarily all related, yet they are tightly connected. Children\nare raised and educated together in such a community, old people are taken care\nof.\n\nAll members of one Arra live in the same huge building or rather structure,\nwhich they also call \"**Arra**\". The Kret very often use the same name for\nsimilar or related concepts. Such a house usually has a large debating and\nleisure hall called \"**Sune**\" as well as a similarly huge dining room called\n\"**Hol**\".\n\nThe families are equally led and represented by one matriarch and one patriarch.\n\nSingle persons don't have comparable importance, weight or rights as in our\nworld. Neither have regions, companies or other social structures. The leading\nsocial concept is the Arra.\n\n## The Kret Society\n\nSo the Kret are physically very similar to us and that they genetically have a\n100.000-year-old history. But they have missed some of the tipping points of\nsocial development, that had led to this explosive exponential growth of the\nhumans on Earth.\n\nStudies from sociologists point out that their way of social interactions and\nthe lack of larger entities like cities or countries could be an explanation.\nLarge scale rivalry could therefore be a motor for such massive infrastructural\nefforts and exponential development as seen on Earth.\n\nAll other aspects of their life point to a culturally rich history that dates\nback to civilizations at least twice as old as the first relatively barbaric\nhuman ones. Remarkably there are also no signs of large-scale disruptions like\nwars or pandemics, which could also be explained by the small-scale social\nstructures.\n\nTheir craftsmanship and their understanding of arts for example are way ahead of\nours. Their knowledge and capabilities in the field of mechanics and their\ninsights into mathematics are extraordinary.\n\nThere is a strong hierarchy of social levels between the arras, the Kret\nfamilies. But the system is not static like castes. Families can rise and fall\nin their reputation.\n\nAdditionally, the system getting more formal at the top, because there has to be\na committee that loosely organizes and monitors global streams and development.\n\nOn Kret, there are nine high families, the so-called \"**Arram Sul**\", who\ndiscuss and tackle these global issues. Each of the nine again has nine allied\nsecond-row families called \"**Arram Mas**\".\n\nEach Arram Sul appoints four ambassadors, the \"**Kala**\". Together with the\nmatriarchs and the patriarchs of the high families, they form a council of 54\nrepresentatives called \"**Kalam Mas**\". This council could be seen as the world\ngovernment. It has an appointed moderator but there is no single leader.\n\nThe society of the Kret doesn't have a legislative power. As for all other parts\nof their life, everyday rules are made within the sovereign family clans, the\nArras.\n\nInstead, they have a code of conduct, a rulebook that in its current form is\nover 5000 years old. It is called \"**Kanota Parchala**\" and contains 1296 hard\nrules by which every Kret citizen including the high members of the Karam Mas\nhas to live.\n\nThe rules are continuously enforced by judges and therefore permanently turned\ninto practical and modern interpretations.\n\nThere is also a second book, the \"**Kanota Posa**\", that describes the structure\nof the Kret society and terms like property, ownership, heritage, consent and\ndecision making as well as the family structures.\n\nAs described several times already, the life of all Kret is taking place inside\ntheir Arras, their families. However, the jurisdiction and its representatives,\nthe judges completely live outside these structures. In the Kret language, they\nare called the \"**Kane**\" (Kah-nay singular **Kano**).\n\nKane enjoy a high reputation within all ranks and hierarchies of the Kret\nsociety. They are completely neutral and don't interfere in any way with the\ndaily business of Arras. They monitor each other with a complex system of\noverlapping responsibilities and territories, checks and balances. So corruption\nexists but its countermeasures are strong and built into the core.\n\nNext to the judges themselves, there is a full administrative infrastructure\nthat takes care of their supply of daily goods, organizational tasks and even\nentertainment. The caste of the Kane is a world on its own.\n\nOnce a month there is a conference where the high council Kalam Mas and the\nsupreme judges (Kane Kane) come together for a mutual exchange.\n\n## Observers\n\nThe way how the Kret were discovered is a story on its own. I'm already in teh\nmiddle of writing, so please be patient. Many aspects of the Kret life will be\nuncovered in anecdotes.\n\nBut let me anyway end with some remarks about us. The human expedition that\nwould set sail to explore the Kret was planned as a lifetime commitment.\nObserving and studying a new species was the ultimate adventure that you could\nembark on in Earth's 23rd century.\n\nBut it would not be a job in isolation and deprivations like many other\nscientific expeditions in the past. The team was huge. About 200 people were on\nthe scientific space station that circled planet Kret. There were all kinds of\ndisciplines involved. From microbiologists to theologists.\n\nBesides the station in Kret's orbit, there also was a cloaked outpost on the\nplanet that mainly hosted relay technology for small undiscoverable robots. They\ncalled them \"The Bugs\". They were only around 1 cm large but equipped with\ncameras, microphones, other sensors and an intelligence that could take\nautonomous decisions.\n\nFirst goal: Don't get caught! Second goal: Record and filter as much relevant\ninformation as possible.\n\nThe team on the space station had a lot of material to explore and received\nstunning results and mindbending facts about that new species, but what they\nlearned about themselves and about us, the humans as a whole was even more\nstunning."

      "Kamina was eleven. Her parents always told her that she had an exuberant\nimagination. They didn't believe her that she permanently fell into holes or\nspoke with rabbits and found herself in other worlds for another great\nadventure. She doesn't dream these things.\n\nThis time it was the mirror in her room, the one that she looked into thousands\nof times before. But that day, her own reflection looked differently. She didn't\nknow exactly what it was. It was still her. She saw her freckles, her earrings,\nthe ones that her granny gave her, and her hair. But wait. Her hair was\ndifferent. It had the same colour, but it was not open. It was straightened with\nclasps. And she suddenly had strange sunglasses on her head and a hat appeared\nin the mirror. She never wore hats. But it looked beautiful. Just not out of\nthis world.\n\nIt seemed like an adventure was calling again. She did the first thing that came\ninto her mind. She touched the mirror and her finger sank in like it was a water\nsurface.",
      "Kamina was a brave girl and she loved adventures. So she made one step forward\nthrough the mirror. A wind blew on her face. That was her first sensation. She\nstill had her eyes closed. When she opened them, the impression was\noverwhelming. She stood on the docks of a harbour.\n\nShe turned around to the city line. There were magnificent office buildings in\nthe front row, that looked some hundred years old. Behind that, she saw the\ngigantic dome of a church and an even bigger church tower. But this one didn't\nlook at all like the pointed steeples she knew. There was a big plateau on top.\nAs she looked around, she saw seven or eight of these. Some nearer, some further\naway.\n\nBut the most astonishing impression came from the sky around that huge tower.\nThere were dozens of - she had to take a more concentrated look - airships\nflying around. Brass and silver steamships that had wings like dragonflies.\n\nShe turned to the quay again and saw a sign. \"Welcome to Etheria\", it said.",
      "From far away, Kamina saw the strange form of a docked ship. She had to look at\nit, so she walked around the harbour quays into its direction. As soon as she\nstood in front, she knew what it was - one of the airships that looked like a\ndragonfly. The body was formed entirely like a regular ship and it was swimming.\nBut two folded mechanic wings came out of its side and spanned the full length\nof the vessel.\n\nShe walked from aft to bow and had a look at all the ornaments and golden\ndecorations on the otherwise dark body. Next to the nose, she saw the name tag\nin squiggly letters. The Phoenix. And the figurehead was a beautiful bird that\ncame out of a cloud.\n\nIn the middle area, there were workers loading the ship using strange vehicles\nwith loud and dirty steam motors. One of them was standing and monitoring the\nothers. That must have been the boss.\n\n\"Hey girl\", he yelled. \"What do you think you're doing here?\"\n\nKamina was very good at doing an innocent face.",
      "Kamina was hanging around for another while. She found a place some meters away\nfrom the boarding and loading zone and watched the seamen do their work. Then\nthe hectic bustle stopped and nobody was seen anymore. Plank and entrance were\nunattended.\n\nShe knew that she had to do it. She had stumbled into all of her previous\nadventures through her gut feeling. So Kamina sneaked into the Phoenix.\n\nThe loading deck was meant for work and storage, so it was quite dirty and there\nwere no ornaments or even paint on the walls. Instead, she saw ropes and chains\nevery meter to fixate the freight. Still, there was nobody in the hallways.\n\nShe found a staircase that went upwards and there they were again, ornaments and\nthe typical dark grey and golden look. She took it and apparently landed in the\ncabin area. Somebody from the crew turned around a corner about ten meters away.\nShe quickly sneaked into one of the cabins and took a breath.\n\nThen the airship started to shake.",
      "Kamina took a look outside the porthole of the cabin and saw that the peer\nbecame smaller and smaller every second. They had been lifting off. They were\nflying. She looked around and saw the gigantic dragonfly wings moving up and\ndown fast. But they almost didn't make any noise. There was just the shaking and\nthe groaning of the wood.\n\nShe dared to open the door and go outside again. The aisle was empty. What\nshould happen? She was on the airship and couldn't be thrown out. So she could\nas well be brave and say hello to the crew. Kamina took the stairs.\n\nEvery floor looked a bit more fancy and beautiful than the previous one. But the\nfourth was a piece of perfect craftsmanship. With amazement, she touched the\nbeautifully carved wall sculptures.\n\n\"Who in Neptune's name are you?\", someone asked suddenly from behind.\n\n\"And who are you?\", was the first thing that came to Kamina's mind.\n\n\"I, little girl, am Sir Tesla, captain of the Phoenix\", and to one of the\nseamen, he said, \"Take her\".",
      "Two tall guys grabbed Kamina and carried her downstairs again into a rather dark\nand dirty deck. They opened a metal door to the brig and threw her in. How rude.\nBut as a last gift, Kamina could scratch the seaman's arm with her pointed\nfingernails. Served him right.\n\nThe dark room had only one small barred porthole. She sat down in one of the\ndirty corners when she heard a whispering from the neighbour cabin.\n\n\"Hello, is there anybody?\", someone said. It was the voice of a boy, Kamina\nguessed.\n\n\"Wo are you?\", she asked with self-confidence as if she was the captain and not\nthe prisoner.\n\n\"Luke. I'm Luke, the kitchen boy.\"\n\n\"Why are you here?\", Kamina wanted to know.\n\n\"I was too slow at peeling potatoes\", Luke answered.\n\n\"Oh. They are so rude on this ship, aren't they? We have to get out of here. Do\nyou know a way?\"\n\n\"Out of the brig? What do you think? Who are you and what makes you think, you\ncould escape from this hole?\"\n\n\"Hmm, I know some tricks\", Kamina answered.",
      "Kamina's plan involved that sooner or later someone had to come and bring them\nsomething to eat and some water. They had to wait. So they could talk and Kamina\nwas able to find out more about this world.\n\nLuke said that their beautiful city Etheria was the stronghold of the rebels and\nthat they were fighting a dark tyrant. Luke called him the Iron Baron. All the\ncities and harbours around Etheria are ruled and suppressed by him. The Phoenix\nand its crew are constantly taking part in raids against the Iron Baron's\nforces.\n\nThey were still in the air when Kamina heard a crash followed by heavy shakes.\nShe couldn't even sit anymore. Probably they were in a battle now. But they\ncouldn't see anything outside the small bull's eye.\n\nIn a mixture of fear and bravery, Kamina and Luke first looked at each other and\nthen to the door of the brig, that sprang open. They took their chance and\nsneaked out. No tricks needed. But Kamina didn't know whether that was good or\nbad",
      "The airship was still shaking and its movement threw them against the left and\nright walls while they were trying to cross the hallway to reach the stairs.\nThey had to get a better view of the outside. What was happening?\n\nBelow deck, they didn’t see anybody. Luke said that everybody would be at their\nbattle station. About three floors upstairs, they saw the first people, gunners\nin black clothes with rather strange hats. It was the deck with the first row of\ncannons. There were hectic movements. Some of them carried heavy iron balls\naround. But also everything seemed to be coordinated like a choreography.\n\nKamina had to watch for some seconds, but Luke pulled her further. When they\narrived at the next deck, Kamina immediately froze. There. There was a hole in\nthe wall that shouldn’t have been there. She could look outside. One of the\nbaron's cannonballs must have struck the Phoenix in here. Still frozen, she\nstares through that hole and saw one of the opponent’s ships on the outside. One\nof the nasty-looking seamen on the other airship looked over and met her eye for\na second.\n\nThat was the point where she quickly woke up again. Her mood turned from afraid\nto angry. She grabbed Luke by the hand.\n\n“We have to do something”, she shouted out to him.\n\n“What do you mean?”, he answered.\n\n“You’ll see …”",
      "Kamina observed through the hole in the wall how the other airship navigated. It\nturned its nose more and more towards the Phoenix. It was also flying at exactly\nthe right height. Just one more second. Wait for it! Now!\n\nLuke still didn’t get what was going on. As Kamina started to run, he had to\nfollow. She pulled him until he also started to run as fast as he could. They\nran along the aisle towards the hole. The timing was almost perfect. At the\npoint in time they jumped, the huge figurehead on the ship’s bow - a gigantic\nbird of prey with huge wings - showed up right in front of them.\n\nTime seemed to stand still for a moment while they were flying through the air.\nIt was only a meter or so but for Luke, it seemed much more.\n\nKamina could grab one of the wings of the figurehead, but she had to let Luke go\nto stabilize herself. But Luke found his way to the other wing. He could not\nfind a hold, but - good luck - his suspenders got caught in the large curved\nbeak of the bird. So he was hanging there safely, dangling dozens of meters\nabove the blue sea.\n\nAs dangerous as the situation had been, the scene looked funny like slapstick\nand Kamina couldn’t help but laugh. After she regained her composure, Luke made\nsure to get a proper hold on his side of the bird and Kamina unstrapped his\nbraces to get him free. Luke still looked baffled and embarrassed. And just then\nhe realized what just happened. They were on the ship of the enemy.\n\n“OK. That worked out”, said Kamina as if it were the easiest thing to do every\nday before breakfast, while Luke was still trying to breathe.\n\n“But what could we do here?”, she added. “ Let’s find a hiding spot first. We\nmust not be seen.”",
      "Some minutes later they sat behind a pile of crates and barrels and could take a\ndeep breath. But looking at Kaminas face, Luke could directly see that her brain\nwas working out the next ideas. In the last minutes, he did more brave things\nthan in his whole life before although he served on a warship. Kamina was just a\nblind passenger though. She didn't know anything about airships or battles. But\nshe was the one who had the ideas. Luke was just following her. He felt the urge\nto contribute something.\n\n\"The buoyancy chambers\", he said while being surprised about himself. \"We can\nlet the airship go down.\"\n\n\"What is a boy chamber?\", Kamina asked. She apparently didn't have any clue\nabout airship tech.\n\n\"The buoyancy chambers are the big balloons that keep the ship in the air. If we\nopen the valves, the airship will lose its buoyancy and go down. They are\ncontrolled remotely from the bridge. So the actual valves might be unattended. I\nknow that from our ship.\"\n\n\"Luke, you're brilliant. We have to find these valve thingies.\"\n\nThey were already on deck, so they couldn't be far from their destination. They\ndared to take a peek beyond their hiding spot. About five shipmen were running\naround occupied with doing their jobs. Left and right there were the gigantic\ndragonfly wings and what spread above their heads were two huge balloon chambers\nthat were formed like raindrops.\n\n\"Look, there are the valves\", Luke said and pointed to the thin end of the\nballoons, where they ended in a wooden top deck with a rusty iron door.\n\n\"We can make it there unseen\", Kamina said. \"We just have to cross this path.\nAnd there, we can hide again and finally reach the door.\"\n\nImpulsive as she was, she wanted to jump out of their hideout right away. Luke\ncould hold her back last minute as one of the guards on deck came around the\ncorner in their direction. Kamina sat back, held her hand in front of her mouth\nand just nodded confirmingly at Luke.\n\nAfter the guard was gone again, they took another look. The coast was clear. So\nthey started running to hide behind the next staple and then reached the door\nunseen.\n\nLuke turned the door knob. It was locked. He looked disappointed. But Kamina\nalready had the clue in her hair. She took one of the clips that held her golden\nlocks back and used it as a lock pick. She had seen it in a movie once. It was\nharder than she thought. She had to feel the mechanism in the inside and at the\nsame time they had to take care not to be seen.\n\nTime went by, she tried and tried. After a while, she had a rough idea what to\ndo.\n\n\"Kamina\", said Luke. \"Quicker. Three seamen are coming. They're almost around\nthe corner. Do you hear the footsteps?\"\n\n\"Yees, I hear them\", she answered annoyed. \"I'm almost there. Just a second.\"\n\nThen the lock clicked and clacked and the door sprang open. They saw the boots\nof the guards and quickly jumped inside the dark room. That was close. Some air\nslots in the door were the only light source they had. Kamina saw the boots of\nthe guards walking by and took a deep breath perfectly in sync with Luke. The\nlooked at each other, nodded, smiled and started to look around.\n\nIt was really dark in there. Now it was Luke's turn for a little miracle. Why\nshouldn't there be light just like in any other room? He knew that it was not\nallowed in gunpowder rooms but in here were only mechanical devices. He saw a\nslightly brighter, swinging object in the middle. That must have been the\npetroleum lantern. He also found a crate in the corner and used it to reach the\nlamp. His very own magic device was a flint stone lighter. He had needed it in\nthe kitchen all the time, so he always kept it in his pocket.\n\nTwo clicks with the flint and he lit the lamp and the room was illuminated in a\nwarm orange tone. They looked around and saw the most complicated mechanical\ndevice they had ever seen. On each side there were huge wooden boxes with gears,\nvalves and levers. On the top they saw two outlets on each side. One surely went\ninto the balloon chamber. The other must have been the air outlet.\n\n\"Luke, you're a genius\", Kamina said.\n\nNow they had everything they needed for their little sabotage.\n\nKamina inspected the left side very closely. She went over its design. Touched\nall of the valves and levers without really pushing any button. She just had to\nfeel the machine in a way. She was thinking and stood there for seconds. Luke\ncould only watch.\n\n\"Luke\", she finally said. We have to do it synchronously Otherwise the ship goes\ndown uncontrolled to the sea level and we sink with it.\"\n\nLuke anxiously walked to the other gear box and looked at it in awe. He could do\nthat. He said this to himself several times in a row. He could do that. But what\nif they were sinking and drowning?\n\nKamina on the other hand was already deep in action. \"Ready, boy?\", she said.\n\n\"Boy?\", Luke said. Did she just call him boy? But it seemed to be what he\nneeded. He was distracted and could finally focus on the task.\n\n\"Just kidding\", Kamina said. \"Let's do it. This is gonna be fun. Now pull the\nleft lever down. This should give you manual control over all the other gizmos.\"\n\nLuke did as he was told. Kamina followed up with several other commands he\nexecuted in perfect sync. One of the last ones actually had an effect and opened\nsome sort of valve. It became very loud in the cabin.\n\n\"Cool, Let's take one last breath\", Kamina shouted and then paused and watched\nLuke for a second. \"Now take the left red knob and turn it 90 degrees to the\nright on three.\"\n\nBoth were standing there in full tension for the count. \"One, two\", Kamina\nyelled, \"aaand three\".\n\nLuke and Kamina were very synchronous. They turned the knobs at the exact same\ntime. But nothing seemed to happen. They were standing there rooted to the spot\nand couldn't move. It felt like hours but it was only seconds until something\nfinally happened. Air blew through the valves of the system. In the beginning it\njust was not enough so they didn't notice. But now it became more and more.\n\nIt was already very loud in the cabin, as if a big hair dryer was running. Then\nthe airship started to shake a little. It started losing altitude.\n\n\"Luke, we did it\", Kamina shouted. \"We did it. We're going down. We have to get\noff. Fast.\"\n\nThey ran out. They didn't bother to look at the guards any more. Everything on\nthe ship seemed to be in alert anyway. It should take only a moment until\nsomeone came around. So they just ran as fast as they could. Kamina had a plan,\nso she was in front showing the direction. She was running towards the bow of\nthe ship. Luke was following her. They had to get to the figurehead. They had to\njump back before it was too late. It was all about timing now.\n\nThey climbed onto a bar beyond the figurehead and monitored the situation. The\nenemy's airship they were on rotated its nose towards the Phoenix. But it also\nlost height a little already. There were ten meters between them and a safe\nplatform on the Phoenix. But the distance became smaller and smaller. Still too\nmuch to jump.\n\nThe guards saw them and started to run towards the ship's bow as well. Some of\nthem had bayonet rifles, that the hastily made ready to shoot. Four metres left.\nKamina ducked and Luke followed her. They saw now that they would have to jump\nupwards to reach the platform. Two metres left. One of the guards was ready to\nshoot and pulled the trigger.\n\nIn that moment three things happened at exactly the same time. Kamina started to\njump while holding Luke's hand. So he automatically jumped with her. While\nliterally flying between the two airships, the bullet hit the figurehead, that\nwas several metres behind them. The wooden bird's left wing exploded and fell\noff. The shot didn't seem to be very precise. And thirdly, the enemy airship\nsuddenly sank down for several metres and the other shooters weren't able to\nstay on their feet. They all lost their balance and fell to the floor in sync as\nif it was a dance move.\n\nAfter the landing, Kamina and Luke were lying on the platform of the Phoenix.\nThey shook off the dust, looked at each other, started laughing and exchanged a\nhigh five.",
      "Two of the Phoenix guards arrived within seconds to capture the intruders, but\nluckily one of them recognized Luke.\n\n\"Wait a second\", he said. \"Aren't you the kitchen boy?\"\n\nBut in that moment, the enemy ship sank down about ten metres at once and the\neven further.\n\n\"What did you do?\", asked the other guard in a rather astonished voice.\n\n\"I guess we've won the battle for you\", Kamina said proudly.\n\n\"You two come with us\", the two guards said almost simultaneously.\n\nKamina and Luke were brought in front of Sir Tesla and were able to tell their\nstory. Of course, the captain didn't believe a word they said.\n\n\"We have sent them to the brick\", he said to one of the officers nearby. \"What\nkind of nonsense is this?\"\n\n\"Sir, the brick has a hole on the outside, Sir\", responded the officer. \"They\nmight have escaped, Sir.\"\n\n\"To the other ship? Are you kidding, officer?\"\n\n\"Sir , no, Sir. Err yes, Sir. We know that the other ship is sinking and we\ndidn't hit it, Sir.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me that their story might be true?\"\n\n\"Sir, yes, Sir. It could be.\"\n\nSir Tesla turned to the kids again. Kamina was already a bit angry, because that\ngrey old boss didn't believe them. But in the moment when she even started those\nthoughts, his face had turned. Only great men can change their opinion, Kamina's\nfather once said to here. Probably Sir Tesla was not such a bad person after\nall.\n\n\"Right the kids\", he said and turned around to the crew again. \"Officer, target\nthe other ship, two cannons, full power. Bring it down.\"\n\n\"And you two are coming with me\", he said to Kamina and Luke.\n\nSir Tesla left the bridge while his officers knew how to deal with the battle\nsituation. They had won. Today at least. Kamina and Luke followed the captain.\nThey went two decks down and to the other side, the aft of the Phoenix. They\nwere sent back to the galley, thought Luke immediately, his workplace. But Sir\nTesla moved on. He turned to Chief Pulley, the chef on the ship and Lukes boss.\n\n\"Chief\", he started. \"These two are the heroes of the day. They have saved our\nship. You get them everything they want and don't you dare to delegate this task\nto anyone else. Clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir\", the chef answered while looking at his kitchen boy and a girl. What\nis a girl doing on their ship, he thought. And what did Luke do now again?\n\n\"They will have dinner with me and the other officers tonight. Prepare something\nspecial. Actually, for the whole crew. Do you have enough food left for a\nfeast?\"\n\n\"I believe so, Sir\", the chef answered. \"We have just raided that other ship of\nthe Iron Baron, Sir. They had good stuff on board.\"\n\n\"Very well then. 1900 it is then. And don't forget the children.\"\n\nSir Tesla left the galley and went back to the bridge. The chef turned to the\nkids and thought about how to do two things at the same time. Preparing a gala\ndinner for one hundred people and taking care of two kids.\n\n\"No worries, Sir\", Luke said as if he knew what was going on in Chief Pulley's\nhead. \"We can help you. We know how to peel potatoes.\"\n\nAnd so they did. The whole kitchen crew plus Kamina were preparing the greates\nparty they could imagine. For Kamina and Luke, it was actually the best possible\nway to come down again and not think too much about their incredible adventure.",
      "After a full clean up and fixing the worst damages, the crew of the Phoenix also\nhad calmed down and everyone, well everyone except the kitchen crew, appeared\nfor dinner to get their well deserved meal.\n\nKamina and Luke were allowed to sit at the captain's table in the officer's mess\ntogether with the highest ranking shipmen of the Phoenix.\n\nSir Tesla was the last to come in and took his seat directly next to Kamina. The\nnoise level in the room was not high but noticeable. Everyone was involved into\na bit of smalltalk with their neighbours until the captain stood up. The room\nimmediately fell silent, except Kamina whispering some nonsense into Luke's ear.\nSir Tesla looked sharply at her and she immediately sat still as well. He\nstarted to smile in a pleased way.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen\", he said. \"Today we have won a battle against the Iron\nBaron. We brought down our enemy's biggest flagship. You should be proud of\nyourselves as I am proud of you, too. But there are two people who deserve our\ngratitude. Two kids, they are sitting right here at this table. Come on, please\nstand up for a moment.\"\n\nKamina and Luke stood up and the whole room started to applaud for minutes - and\nthat although everyone was very hungry. Kamina at least heard her stomach, and\nLukes. But she also felt very proud. She had never been applauded before. So she\nalmost cried, but could hold it.\n\nNeither her nor Luke could say a word, so they slowly sat down again, just like\nall the others.\n\n\"I think, we deserve some food now\", Sir Tesla said and everyone applauded again\nwhile Chief Pulley and his crew came in with the first course, some exotic\nvegetables that even Luke hadn't seen before. But they tasted heavenly\ndelicious.\n\nEveryone was well fed and happy after the dessert, the fourth course of the\nevening. Kamina even could barely get the last piece of chocolate cake into her\nmouth. That probably had never happened before. It was so delicious, but she was\nfull.\n\n\"Children\", said Sir Tesla finally. \"Thank you for your help today. I still\ndon't know how you managed it, but it was very brave. We have prepared two noble\nofficer's cabins for you. You can stay here for the night and we will bring you\nback to Etheria tomorrow.\"",
      "What a day, thought Kamina finally alone in her cabin. She absolutely likes the\ntrouble and the hustle and bustle. But she also loves to calm down after an\nadventure.\n\nBut while she stared at the mirror next to her bed, she felt a force that drew\nher in. She knew that it was the call back home. She touched the mirror and her\nfinger sank in like it was a water surface. Then she stepped through and\nappeared in her room at home again."

      "Kamina war elf Jahre alt. Ihre Eltern sagten ihr immer, sie habe eine\nüberbordende Fantasie. Sie haben ihr nicht geglaubt, dass sie ständig in Löcher\nfällt oder mit Kaninchen spricht und sich in anderen Welten wiederfindet, um ein\nweiteres großes Abenteuer zu erleben. Sie träumt diese Dinge nicht.\n\nDiesmal war es der Spiegel in ihrem Zimmer, in den sie schon tausende Male\ngeschaut hatte. Aber an diesem Tag sah ihr eigenes Spiegelbild anders aus. Sie\nwusste nicht genau, was es war. Es war immer noch sie. Sie sah ihre\nSommersprossen, ihre Ohrringe, die von ihrer Oma, und ihre Haare. Aber halt. Ihr\nHaar war anders. Es hatte die gleiche Farbe, aber es war nicht offen. Es war mit\nSpangen geglättet. Plötzlich hatte sie eine seltsame Sonnenbrille auf dem Kopf\nund im Spiegel erschien ein Hut. Sie trug nie Hüte. Aber er sah schön aus. Nur\nnicht von dieser Welt.\n\nEs schien, als würde wieder ein Abenteuer rufen. Sie tat das Erste, was ihr in\nden Sinn kam. Sie berührte den Spiegel und ihr Finger sank ein, als wäre es eine\nWasseroberfläche.",
      "Kamina ist ein mutiges Mädchen. Also tut sie das für sie einzig logische und\nmacht einen Schritt vorwärts durch den Spiegel. Das erste, was sie spürte war\nein warmer Wind, der ihr ins Gesicht wehte. Sie hatte ihre Augen noch\ngeschlossen. Als sie sie öffnete, war der Eindruck überwältigend. Sie stand auf\nden Docks in einem Hafen.\n\nSie ließ ihren blick zur Stadt schweifen. In der ersten Reihe standen prächtige\nKontorgebäude, die einige hundert Jahre alt zu sein schienen. Dahinter sah sie\ndie gigantische Kuppel einer Kirche und einen noch größeren Kirchturm. Aber\ndieser sah ganz und gar nicht aus wie die spitzen Türme, die sie kannte. Oben\nbefand sich ein großes Plateau. Als sie sich umschaute, sah sie sieben oder acht\ndavon, manche näher, manche weiter weg.\n\nAber den erstaunlichsten Eindruck vermittelte der Himmel rund um den riesigen\nTurm. Dort flogen dutzende von - sie musste genauer hinsehen - Luftschiffen\nherum. Dampfschiffe aus Messing und Silber, die Flügel wie Libellen hatten.\n\nSie wandte sich wieder dem Kai zu und sah ein Schild. Darauf stand \"Willkommen\nin Etheria\".",
      "Aus der Ferne sah Kamina die seltsame Form eines angedockten Schiffes. Sie\nmusste es sich näher ansehen also ging sie um die Hafenkais herum in seine\nRichtung. Sobald sie davor stand, wusste sie, was es war - eines diseder\nLuftschiffe, die wie Libellen aussahen. Der Rumpf war aus Holz und wie ein\nnormales Schiff geformt, und es schwamm auf der Wasseroberfläche wie jedes\nandere Schiff. Aber zwei gefaltete mechanische Flügel kamen an der Seite heraus\nund überspannten die gesamte Länge des Schiffes.\n\nSie ging vom Heck zum Bug und betrachtete all die Ornamente und goldenen\nVerzierungen auf dem ansonsten dunklen Körper. Neben der Nase sah sie das\nNamensschild in verschnörkelten Buchstaben. Die Phönix. Und die Galionsfigur war\nein wunderschöner Vogel, der aus einer Wolke herausflog.\n\nIm mittleren Bereich liefen Arbeiter herum, die das Schiff mit seltsamen\nFahrzeugen mit lauten und schmutzigen Dampfmotoren beluden. Einer von ihnen\nstand da und überwachte die anderen. Das muss der Chef gewesen sein.\n\n\"Hey Mädchen\", rief er. \"Was glaubst du, was du hier tust?\"\n\nKamina war sehr gut darin, ein unschuldiges Gesicht zu machen.",
      "Sie hing noch eine Weile herum. fand einen Platz einige Meter entfernt von der\nEinsteige- und Ladezone und beobachtete die Seeleute bei ihrer Arbeit. Dann\nhörte die hektische Betriebsamkeit auf und niemand war mehr zu sehen. Planke und\nEingang waren unbewacht.\n\nSie wusste, dass sie es tun musste. In all ihren bisherigen Abenteuern wurde sie\ndurch ihr Bauchgefühl geleitet. Also schlich sich Kamina in die Phoenix.\n\nDas Ladedeck war für Arbeit und Lager gedacht, daher war es ziemlich schmutzig\nund es gab es waren keine Verzierungen oder gar Farbe an den Wänden zu sehen.\nStattdessen befanden sich dort Seile und Ketten im Abstand von etwa einem Meter,\nvermutlich um die Fracht zu befestigen. Doch auch hier in den Gängen war niemand\nzu sehen.\n\nSie fand eine Treppe, die nach oben führte, und da waren sie wieder, die\nOrnamente und das typische dunkelgraue und goldene Aussehen. Sie ging hoch und\nlandete offenbar im Kabinenbereich. In etwa zehn Metern Entfernung bog jemand\nvon der Besatzung um eine Ecke. Schnell schlich sie sich in eine der Kabinen und\nholte kurz Luft.\n\nDann begann das Luftschiff zu schaukeln.",
      "Kamina warf einen Blick aus dem Bullauge und sah, dass der Pier jede Sekunde\nkleiner und kleiner wurde. Sie hatten abgehoben. Sie flogen. Sie schaute sich um\nund sah, wie sich die riesigen Libellenflügel schnell auf und ab bewegten. Aber\nsie machten fast keine Geräusche. Man spürte nur das Schütteln und das Ächzen\ndes Holzes.\n\nSie wagte es, die Tür zu öffnen und wieder nach draußen zu gehen. Der Korridor\nwar leer. Was sollte schon passieren? Sie war auf dem Luftschiff und konnte\nnicht hinausgeworfen werden. Also konnte sie genauso gut mutig sein und der\nBesatzung Hallo sagen. Kamina nahm die Treppe.\n\nJede Etage sah ein bisschen schicker und schöner aus als die vorherige. Aber die\nvierte war perfekte Handwerkskunst. Mit Erstaunen berührte sie die wunderschön\ngeschnitzten Wandskulpturen.\n\n\"Wer in Neptuns Namen bist Du?\", fragte plötzlich jemand von hinten.\n\n\"Und wer bist du?\", war das erste, was Kamina in den Sinn kam.\n\n\"Ich, kleines Mädchen, bin Sir Tesla, Kapitän der Phoenix\", und zu einem der\nMatrosen sagte er: \"Festnehmen\".",
      "Zwei große Kerle packten Kamina und trugen sie die Treppe wieder hinunter in ein\nziemlich dunkles und schmutziges Deck. Sie öffneten eine Metalltür zur\nArrestzelle und warfen sie hinein. Wie unhöflich. Aber als letztes Geschenk\nkonnte Kamina den Seemann mit ihren spitzen Fingernägeln am Arm ein paar tiefe\nKratzer verpassen. Das geschah ihm recht.\n\nDer dunkle Raum hatte nur ein kleines vergittertes Bullauge. Sie setzte sich in\neine der schmutzigen Ecken, als sie ein Flüstern aus der Nachbarkabine hörte.\n\n\"Hallo, wer ist da?\", sagte jemand. Es war die Stimme eines Jungen, vermutete\nKamina.\n\n\"Wer bist du?\", fragte sie so selbstbewusst, als wäre sie der Kapitän und nicht\nder Gefangene.\n\n\"Luke. Ich bin Luke, der Küchenjunge.\"\n\n\"Warum bist du hier?\", wollte Kamina wissen.\n\n\"Ich war zu langsam beim Kartoffelschälen\", antwortete Luke.\n\n\"Oh. Sie sind so unhöflich auf diesem Schiff, nicht wahr? Wir müssen von hier\nverschwinden. Kennst du einen Weg?\"\n\n\"Aus der Arrestzelle? Was denkst du denn? Wer bist du und wie kommst du darauf,\ndass du aus diesem Loch entkommen kannst?\"\n\n\"Hmm, ich kenne ein paar Tricks\", antwortete Kamina.",
      "Kaminas Plan sah vor, dass früher oder später jemand kommen und ihnen etwas zu\nessen und etwas Wasser bringen würde. Sie mussten warten. So konnten sie sich\netwas unterhalten und Kamina konnte mehr über diese Welt herausfinden.\n\nLuke erzählte, dass ihre schöne Stadt Etheria die Hochburg der Rebellen war und\ndass sie gegen einen dunklen Tyrannen kämpften. Luke nannte ihn den Eisernen\nBaron. Alle Städte und Häfen um Etheria werden von ihm beherrscht und\nunterdrückt. Die Phoenix und ihre Besatzung nahmen ständig an Überfällen gegen\ndie Streitkräfte des Eisernen Barons teil.\n\nSie waren noch in der Luft, als Kamina ein Krachen hörte, gefolgt von heftigen\nErschütterungen. Sie konnte nicht einmal mehr sitzen. Wahrscheinlich befanden\nsie sich jetzt in einer Schlacht. Aber durch das kleine Bullauge konnten sie\nnichts sehen.\n\nIn einer Mischung aus Angst und Mut sahen Kamina und Luke erst einander an und\ndann zur Tür der Brigg, die aufsgesprungen war. Sie nutzten ihre Chance und\nschlichen sich hinaus. Keine Tricks nötig. Aber Kamina wusste nicht, ob das gut\noder schlecht war.",
      "Das Luftschiff bebte noch immer und seine Bewegung warf sie gegen die linke und\nrechte Wand, während sie versuchten, den Gang zu überqueren, um die Treppe zu\nerreichen. Sie mussten eine bessere Aussicht auf die Außenseite bekommen. Was\npassierte da gerade?\n\nUnter Deck sahen sie niemanden. Luke sagte, dass jeder an seiner Kampfstation\nsein würde. Etwa drei Stockwerke höher sahen sie die ersten Menschen, Schützen\nin schwarzer Kleidung mit eher seltsamen Hüten. Es war das Deck mit der ersten\nReihe von Kanonen. Es gab hektische Bewegungen. Einige der Kanoniere trugen\nschwere Eisenkugeln herum. Aber es sah auch alles auch alles sehr koordiniert\naus, fast wie ein Tanz.\n\nKamina musste einige Sekunden lang zuschauen, aber Luke zog sie weiter. Als sie\nauf dem nächsten Deck ankamen, erstarrte Kamina sofort. Dort. Dort war ein Loch\nin der Wand, das nicht da sein sollte. Sie konnte nach draußen sehen. Eine der\nKanonenkugeln des Barons muss die Phoenix hier getroffen haben. Noch immer\nerstarrt, blickte sie durch dieses Loch und sah eines der gegnerischen Schiffe\ndraußen. Ein unangenehm aussehender Seemann auf dem anderen Luftschiff sah zu\nihr rüber und traf für eine Sekunde ihren Blick.\n\nDas war der Zeitpunkt, an dem sie schnell wieder aufwachte. Ihre Stimmung\nwandelte sich von Angst in Wut. Sie packte Luke am Arm.\n\n\"Wir müssen etwas tun\", rief sie ihm zu.\n\n\"Was meinst du?\", antwortete er.\n\n\"Das wirst Du schon sehen...\"",
      "Kamina sah durch das Loch in der Wand, wie das andere Luftschiff navigierte. Es\ndrehte seine Nase immer mehr in Richtung der Phoenix. Es schwebte auch genau in\nder richtigen Höhe. Nur noch eine Sekunde. Einen Moment. Jetzt!\n\nLuke verstand immer noch nicht, was vor sich ging. Als Kamina zu rennen begann,\nmusste er ihr folgen. Sie zog ihn, bis auch er anfing zu rennen, so schnell er\nkonnte. Sie rannten den Gang entlang in Richtung des Lochs. Das Timing war fast\nperfekt. Genau in dem Moment als sie lossprangen, tauchte die riesige\nGalionsfigur am Bug des anderen Schiffes, ein Raubvogel mit riesigen Flügeln,\nvor ihnen auf.\n\nDie Zeit schien einen Moment lang stillzustehen, während sie durch die Luft\nflogen. Es war nur ein Meter oder so, aber für Luke schien es viel weiter zu\nsein.\n\nKamina konnte sich an einem der Flügel der Galionsfigur festhalten, aber sie\nmusste Luke loslassen, um sich zu stabilisieren. Aber Luke fand seinen Weg zum\nanderen Flügel. Er konnte keinen Halt finden, aber zum Glück verfingen sich\nseine Hosenträger im großen gebogenen Schnabel des Vogels. So hing er gut\ngesichert und baumelte Dutzende von Metern über dem blauen Meer.\n\nSo gefährlich die Situation auch gewesen war, so lustig sah die Szene nun aus,\nwie Slapstick-Sketch. Kamina konnte sich ein Lachen nicht verkneifen. Nachdem\nsie sich wieder gefangen hatte, sorgte Luke dafür, dass er sich auf seiner Seite\ndes Vogels richtig festhalten konnte. Kamina löste die Klammern an seinen\nHosenträgern, um ihn zu befreien. Luke sah immer noch verwirrt und verlegen aus.\nUnd erst dann wurde ihm klar, was gerade passiert war. Sie hatten das Schiff\nihrer Feinde geentert.\n\n\"OK. Das hat geklappt\", sagte Kamina, als wäre es das Einfachste, was man so\njeden Tag vor dem Frühstück erledigte, während Luke immer noch versuchte,\ndurchzuatmen.\n\n\"Aber was können wir hier tun?\", fügte sie hinzu. \"Suchen wir uns erst einmal\nein Versteck. Wir dürfen nicht gesehen werden.\"",
      "Einige Minuten später saßen sie hinter einem Stapel von Kisten und Fässern und\nkonnten kurz durchatmen. Aber als er in Kaminas Gesicht sah, konnte Luke direkt\nerkennen, dass ihr Gehirn bereits die nächsten Ideen ausarbeitete. In den\nletzten Minuten hatte er mehr mutige Dinge getan als in seinem ganzen bisherigen\nLeben, obwohl er auf einem Kriegsschiff diente. Kamina war dagegen nur ein\nblinder Passagier. Sie wusste nichts über Luftschiffe oder Schlachten. Aber sie\nwar diejenige, die die Ideen hatte. Luke folgte ihr nur. Er fühlte den Drang,\netwas beizutragen.\n\n\"Die Auftriebskammern\", sagte er, während er über sich selbst überrascht war.\n\"Wir können das Luftschiff nach unten sinken lassen.\"\n\n\"Was ist eine Auftriebskammer?\", fragte Kamina. Sie hatte offenbar keine Ahnung\nvon der Technik hier.\n\n\"Die Auftriebskammern sind die großen Ballons, die das Schiff in der Luft\nhalten. Wenn wir die Ventile öffnen, verliert das Luftschiff seinen Auftrieb und\nsinkt tiefer. Sie werden von der Brücke aus ferngesteuert. Die eigentlichen\nVentile könnten also unbeaufsichtigt sein. Das weiß ich von unserem Schiff.\"\n\n\"Luke, du bist brillant. Wir müssen diese Ventil-Dinger finden.\"\n\nSie waren bereits an Deck, also konnten sie nicht mehr weit von ihrem Ziel\nentfernt sein. Sie wagten einen Blick Über ihr Versteck hinweg. Etwa fünf\nMatrosen liefen herum und waren mit ihrer Arbeit beschäftigt. Links und rechts\nwaren die riesigen Libellenflügel zu sehen, und über ihren Köpfen erstreckten\nsich zwei große Ballonkammern, die wie liegende Regentropfen geformt waren.\n\n\"Schau, da sind die Ventile\", sagte Luke und zeigte auf das dünne Ende der\nBallons, wo sie in einem hölzernen Oberdeck mit einer rostigen Eisentür endeten.\n\n\"Wir können es ungesehen dorthin schaffen\", sagte Kamina. \"Wir müssen nur diesen\nWeg überqueren. Und dort können wir uns wieder verstecken und endlich die Tür\nerreichen.\"\n\nImpulsiv wie sie war, wollte sie sofort aus ihrem Versteck springen. Luke konnte\nsie im letzten Moment zurückhalten, als eine der Wachen an Deck um die Ecke in\nihre Richtung kam. Kamina lehnte sich zurück, hielt sich die Hand vor den Mund\nund nickte Luke nur bestätigend zu.\n\nNachdem die Wache wieder verschwunden war, schauten sie sich noch einmal um. Die\nLuft war rein. Also rannten sie los, um sich hinter dem nächsten Stapel zu\nverstecken, und erreichten schließlich ungesehen die Tür.\n\nLuke drehte den Türknauf. Sie war verschlossen. Er sah enttäuscht aus. Aber\nKamina wusste was zu tum ist und hatte das Werkzeug bereits in ihrem Haar. Sie\nnahm eine der Klammern, die ihre goldenen Locken zurückhielten, und benutzte sie\nals Dietrich. Sie hatte es einmal in einem Film gesehen. Es war schwieriger, als\nsie dachte. Sie musste sich konzentrieren, um den Mechanismus im Inneren\nertasten und gleichzeitig darauf achten, dass sie nicht entdeckt werden.\n\nDie Zeit verging, sie probierte und probierte. Nach einer Weile hatte sie eine\nungefähre Vorstellung, was zu tum war.\n\n\"Kamina\", sagte Luke. \"Schneller. Drei Seeleute sind im Anmarsch. Sie sind fast\num die der Ecke. Hörst du die Schritte?\"\n\n\"Ja, ich höre sie\", antwortete sie genervt. \"Ich bin gleich fertig. Nur noch\neine Sekunde.\"\n\nDann klickte und klapperte das Schloss und die Tür sprang auf. Sie sahen die\nStiefel der Wachen und sprangen schnell ins Innere des dunklen Raums. Das war\nknapp. Ein paar Luftschlitze in der Tür waren die einzige Lichtquelle, die sie\nhatten. Kamina sah die Stiefel der Wachen und atmete tief durch, ganz im\nEinklang mit Luke. Sie sahen sich an, nickten, grinsten und begannen, sich\numzusehen.\n\nEs war wirklich sehr dunkel. Jetzt war es an Lukes, ein kleines Wunder zu\nvollbringen. Warum sollte es nicht wie in jedem anderen Zimmer auch eine\nDeckenleuchte geben? Er wusste, dass es in Schießpulverräumen nicht erlaubt war,\naber hier gab es nur mechanische Geräte. Er sah ein etwas helleren, schwingenden\nGegenstand in der Mitte der Decke. Das musste die Petroleumlaterne sein. Er fand\nauch eine Kiste in der Ecke und benutzte sie, um an die Lampe heranzukommen.\nSein ureigenes magisches Gerät war ein Feuersteinfeuerzeug. Er hatte es in der\nKüche gebraucht, deshalb befand es sich immer immer in seiner Tasche.\n\nMit zwei Zündungen mit dem Feuerstein brachte er die Lampe zum leuchten und der\nRaum erstrahlte in einem warmen Orangeton. Sie schauten sich um und sahen das\nkomplizierteste mechanische Gerät, das sie je gesehen hatten. Auf jeder Seite\nbefanden sich riesige Holzkästen mit Zahnrädern, Ventilen und Hebeln. Oben sahen\nsie zwei Auslässe auf jeder Seite. Einer ging sicherlich in die Ballonkammern.\nDer andere muss der Luftauslass gewesen sein.\n\n\"Luke, du bist ein Genie\", sagte Kamina.\n\nJetzt hatten sie alles, was sie für ihren kleinen Sabotageakt brauchten.\n\nKamina untersuchte die linke Seite sehr genau. Sie ging durch alle Details,\nberührte alle Ventile und Hebel an, ohne wirklich einen Knopf zu drücken. Sie\nmusste einfach irgendwie die Maschine fühlen. Sie dachte nach und stand\nsekundenlang da. Luke konnte nur zusehen.\n\n\"Luke\", sagte sie schließlich. Wir müssen es exakt gleichzeitig machen, sonst\nfällt das Schiff unkontrolliert auf die Meeresoberfläche und wir sinken mit\nihm.\"\n\nLuke ging leicht verängstigt zu dem anderen Getriebe und betrachtete es\nstaunend. Er schaffte das. Das sagte er sich mehrere Male hintereinander. Er\nwürde es schaffen. Aber was wenn sie sinken und ertrinken würden?\n\nKamina hingegen war schon voll in Aktion. \"Fertig, Junge?\", sagte sie.\n\n\"Junge?\", sagte Luke. Hatte sie ihn gerade Junge genannt? Aber es schien genau\ndas zu sein, was er gerade brauchen. Er war abgelenkt und konnte sich endlich\nauf die Aufgabe konzentrieren.\n\n\"War nur ein Scherz\", sagte Kamina. \"Lass es uns tun. Das wird ein Spaß. Jetzt\nzieh den linken Hebel nach unten. Damit kannst du alle anderen Teile manuell\nsteuern.\"\n\nLuke tat, was ihm gesagt wurde. Kamina folgte mit mehreren weiteren Befehlen,\ndie er in perfekter Synchronisation ausführte. Einer der letzten hatte\ntatsächlich eine spürbare Wirkung und öffnete eine Art Ventil. Es wurde sehr\nlaut in der Kabine.\n\n\"Cool, lass uns einen letzten Atemzug nehmen\", rief Kamina, hielt dann inne und\nbeobachtete Lukas einen Moment lang. \"Jetzt nimm den linken roten Knopf und\ndrehe ihn um 90 Grad nach rechts. Auf drei.\"\n\nBeide standen da und warteten gespannt auf den Countdown. \"Eins, zwei\", schrie\nKamina, \"uuuund drei\".\n\nLuke und Kamina waren vollständig synchron. Sie drehten die Knöpfe genau zur\ngleichen Zeit. Aber es schien nichts zu passieren. Sie standen wie angewurzelt\nauf der Stelle und wagten es nicht sich zu bewegen. Es fühlte sich wie Stunden\nan, aber es vergingen nur ein paar Sekunden, bis endlich etwas passierte. Luft\nströmte durch die Ventile des Systems. Am Anfang war es einfach nicht genug, so\ndass sie es nicht bemerkten. Aber jetzt wurde es immer mehr.\n\nEs war schon sehr laut in der Kabine, so als ob ein großer Fön laufen würde.\nDann begann das Luftschiff ein wenig zu wackeln. Es verlor an Höhe.\n\n\"Luke, wir haben es geschafft\", rief Kamina. \"Wir haben es geschafft. Wir\nstürzen ab. Wir müssen raus hier. Schnell.\"\n\nSie rannten hinaus. Sie machten sich nicht einmal mehr die Mühe, die Wachen im\nAuge zu behalten. Auf dem Schiff schien nun ohnehin alles in Alarmbereitschaft\nzu sein. Es sollte nur einen Moment dauern, bis jemand vorbeikam. Also rannten\nsie einfach so schnell sie konnten. Kamina hatte ihren Plan im Kopf, also war\nsie vorne und gab die Richtung vor. Sie rannte auf den Bug des Schiffes zu. Luke\nfolgte ihr. Sie mussten zur Galionsfigur gelangen. Sie mussten zurückzur Phoenix\nspringen, bevor es zu spät war. Jetzt kam es nur noch auf das richtige Timing\nan.\n\nSie kletterten auf eine Stange vor der Galionsfigur und beobachteten die\nSituation. Das feindliche Luftschiff, auf dem sie sich befanden, drehte seine\nNase in Richtung der Phoenix. Aber es verlor auch schon ein wenig an Höhe.\nZwischen ihnen und einer sicheren Zielplattform auf der Phoenix lagen noch etwa\nzehn Meter. Aber der Abstand wurde immer kleiner. Immer noch zu viel, um zu\nspringen.\n\nDie Wachen sahen sie und begannen, ebenfalls auf den Bug des Schiffes\nzuzulaufen. Einige von ihnen hatten Bajonett-Gewehre, die sie eilig schussbereit\nmachten. Noch vier Meter zwischen der Phoenix und ihrem Schiff. Kamina duckte\nsich und Luke folgte ihr. Sie sahen nun, dass sie auch etwas nach oben springen\nmussten, um die Plattform zu erreichen, da sie schon weiter gesunken waren. Noch\nzwei Meter. Eine der Wachen war bereit zu schießen und drückte ab.\n\nIn diesem Moment geschahen drei Dinge genau zur gleichen Zeit. Kamina begann zu\nspringen, während sie Lukes Hand hielt. So sprang er automatisch mit ihr.\nWährend sie buchstäblich zwischen den beiden Luftschiffen flogen, traf die Kugel\ndes einen Matrosen die Galionsfigur, die sich einige Meter hinter ihnen befand.\nDer linke Flügel des Holzvogels explodierte und fiel ab. Der Schuss schien nicht\nsehr präzise gewesen zu sein. Und drittens sackte das feindliche Luftschiff\nplötzlich mehrere Meter in die Tiefe und die anderen Schützen konnten sich nicht\nmehr auf den Beinen halten. Sie verloren alle das Gleichgewicht und fielen\nsynchron zu Boden, als wäre es ein eingeprobtes Balletstück gewesen.\n\nNach der Landung lagen Kamina und Luke auf der Plattform der Phoenix. Sie\nschüttelten den Staub ab, sahen sich kurz an, begannen zu lachen und gaben sich\nein High Five.",
      "Nur Sekunden später trafen zwei der Phoenix-Wachen ein, um die Eindringlinge\nfestzunehmen, aber zum Glück erkannte einer von ihnen Luke.\n\n\"Warte mal kurz\", sagte er. \"Bist du nicht der Küchenjunge?\"\n\nDoch in diesem Moment sank das feindliche Schiff auf einmal um etwa zehn Meter\nweiter nach unten und sank danach immer tiefer.\n\n\"Was habt ihr getan?\", fragte der andere Wachmann mit ziemlich erstaunter\nStimme.\n\n\"Ich schätze, wir haben die Schlacht für euch gewonnen\", sagte Kamina stolz.\n\n\"Ihr zwei kommt mit uns\", sagten die beiden Wachen fast gleichzeitig.\n\nKamina und Luke wurden vor Sir Tesla gebracht und konnten ihre Geschichte\nerzählen. Natürlich glaubte der Kapitän ihnen kein einziges Wort.\n\n\"Wir hatten sie doch in die Brigg gesteckt\", sagte er zu einem der Offiziere in\nder Nähe. \"Was ist das denn für ein Unsinn?\"\n\n\"Sir, die Brigg hat ein Loch an der Außenseite, Sir\", antwortete der Offizier.\n\"Sie könnten eventuell entkommen sein, Sir.\"\n\n\"Zu dem anderen Schiff? Machen Sie Witze, Offizier?\"\n\n\"Sir, nein, Sir. Äh, ja, Sir. Wir wissen, dass das andere Schiff sinkt und dass\nwir es nicht getroffen haben, Sir.\"\n\n\"Wollen Sie damit sagen, dass deren Geschichte wahr sein könnte?\"\n\n\"Sir, ja, Sir. Es könnte sein.\"\n\nSir Tesla wandte sich wieder an die Kinder. Kamina war schon ein bisschen\nwütend, weil der graue alte Kapitän ihnen nicht glaubte. Aber in dem Moment, als\nsie diesen Gedanken hatte, hatte sich sein Gesicht schon verändert. Nur große\nMänner können ihre Meinung ändern, hatte Kaminas Vater einmal zu ihr gesagt.\nWahrscheinlich war Sir Tesla doch kein so schlechter Mensch.\n\n\"Richtig, Kinder\", sagte er und wandte sich schon wieder an die Mannschaft.\n\"Offiziere, zielen Sie auf das andere Schiff, zwei Kanonen, volle Kraft. Holt es\nendgültig runter.\"\n\n\"Und ihr zwei kommt mit mir\", sagte er zu Kamina und Luke.\n\nSir Tesla verließ die Brücke, während seine Offiziere wussten, wie sie mit der\nKampfsituation umgehen sollten. Sie hatten gewonnen, wenigstens heute. Kamina\nund Luke folgten dem Kapitän. Sie gingen zwei Decks tiefer und auf die andere\nSeite, das Heck der Phoenix. Man schickte sie zurück in die Kombüse, dachte Luke\nsofort, an seinen Arbeitsplatz. Aber Sir Tesla ging weiter. Er wandte sich an\nChief Pulley, den Chefkoch des Schiffes und Lukes Vorgesetzten.\n\n\"Chief\", begann er. \"Diese beiden sind die Helden des Tages. Sie haben unser\nSchiff gerettet. Sie besorgen ihnen alles, was sie wollen, und wagen Sie es\nnicht, diese Aufgabe an jemand anderen zu delegieren. Verstanden?\"\n\n\"Jawohl, Sir\", antwortete der Koch und sah seinen Küchenjungen und das Mädchen\nverwundert an. Was machte ein Mädchen auf ihrem Schiff, dachte er. Und was hatte\nLuke jetzt schon wieder angestellt?\n\n\"Sie werden heute Abend mit mir und den anderen Offizieren zu Abend essen.\nBereiten Sie etwas Besonderes vor. Eigentlich für die ganze Besatzung. Haben Sie\ngenug Essen für ein Festmahl übrig?\"\n\n\"Ich glaube schon, Sir\", antwortete der Koch. \"Wir haben gerade das andere\nSchiff des Eisernen Barons geplündert, Sir. Die hatten gute Vorräte an Bord.\"\n\n\"Nun gut. Dann also 1900. Und vergessen Sie die Kinder nicht.\"\n\nSir Tesla verließ die Kombüse und ging zurück auf die Brücke. Der Koch wandte\nsich den Kindern zu und überlegte, wie er zwei Dinge gleichzeitig tun konnte,\nein Gala-Dinner für hundert Personen zubereiten und sich um zwei Kinder kümmern.\n\n\"Keine Sorge, Sir\", sagte Luke, als wüsste er, was in Chief Pulleys Kopf vor\nsich ging. \"Wir können Ihnen helfen. Wir wissen, wie man Kartoffeln schält.\"\n\nUnd das taten sie auch. Die gesamte Küchencrew und Kamina bereiteten die tollste\nParty vor, die sie sich vorstellen konnten. Für Kamina und Luke war es\neigentlich die beste Möglichkeit, wieder herunterzukommen und nicht zu sehr an\nihr unglaubliches Abenteuer zu denken.",
      "Nach einer umfassenden Aufräumaktion und der Beseitigung der schlimmsten Schäden\nhatte sich auch die Besatzung der Phoenix beruhigt und alle, bis auf die\nKüchencrew, erschienen zum Abendessen, um ihre wohlverdiente Mahlzeit zu\nbekommen.\n\nKamina und Luke durften in der Offiziersmesse am Tisch des Kapitäns sitzen\nzusammen mit den ranghöchsten Schiffsleuten der Phoenix sitzen.\n\nSir Tesla kam als letzter herein und nahm direkt neben Kamina Platz. Der\nLärmpegel im Raum war nicht hoch, aber spürbar. Jeder war in einen Smalltalk mit\nseinen Nachbarn verwickelt, bis der Kapitän aufstand. Der Raum wurde sofort\nstill, außer Kamina, die Luke irgendeinen Unsinn ins Ohr flüsterte. Sir Tesla\nschaute sie scharf an, und auch sie hörte sofort auf zu reden. Er lächelte\nsichtlich erfreut.\n\n\"Meine Damen und Herren\", sagte er. \"Heute haben wir eine bedeutende Schlacht\ngegen den Eisernen Baron gewonnen. Wir haben das größte Flaggschiff unseres\nFeindes zu Fall gebracht. Sie sollten alle stolz auf sich sein, genauso wie ich\nauch besonders stolz auf Sie bin. Aber es gibt zwei Personen, die unseren\nspeziellen Dank verdienen. Zwei Kinder, die genau hier an diesem Tisch sitzen.\nKommt schon, bitte steht einen Moment auf.\"\n\nKamina und Luke standen auf und der ganze Raum begann minutenlang zu\napplaudieren - und und das, obwohl alle sehr hungrig waren. Kamina hörte\nzumindest ihren eigenen Magen knurren - und Lukes. Aber sie fühlte sich auch\nsehr stolz. Sie war noch nie zuvor beklatscht worden. Und so hätte sie fast\ngeweint, konnte es aber zurückhalten.\n\nWeder sie noch Luke konnten ein Wort herausbringen, also setzten sie sich\nlangsam wieder hin, genau wie alle anderen.\n\n\"Ich glaube, wir haben uns jetzt etwas zu essen verdient\", sagte Sir Tesla, der\nnun wieder als Einziger stand. Alle applaudierten erneut, während der Koch Chief\nPulley und seine Crew den ersten Gang brachten, ein exotisches Gemüse, das\nselbst Luke noch nie gesehen hatte. Aber sie schmeckten himmlisch köstlich.\n\nNach dem Dessert, dem vierten Gang des Abends, waren alle satt und zufrieden.\nKamina brachte das letzte Stück Schokoladenkuchen kaum in den Mund, schaffte es\ndann aber doch. Das war ihr wahrscheinlich noch nie passiert. Er war so lecker,\naber sie war voll.\n\n\"Kinder\", sagte Sir Tesla schließlich. \"Ich danke euch für eure Hilfe heute. Ich\nweiß immer noch nicht, wie ihr das geschafft habt, aber es war sehr mutig. Wir\nhaben für euch zwei edle Offizierskabinen vorbereitet. Ihr könnt hier\nübernachten und wir bringen Euch morgen zurück nach Etheria.\"",
      "Was für ein Tag, dachte Kamina, endlich allein in ihrer Kabine. Sie mag den\nÄrger und das den Trubel und die Betriebsamkeit. Aber sie liebt es auch, sich\nnach einem Abenteuer entspannt ins Bell legen zu können. Ihr Schlaf ist dann\nimmer besonders tief und Ihre Träume von weiteren Abenteuern besonders schön.\n\nDoch während sie kurz in den Spiegel neben ihrem Bett starrte, spürte sie eine\nKraft, die sie sie anzog. Sie wusste, dass es der Ruf nach Hause war. Sie\nberührte den Spiegel und ihr Finger sank ein, als wäre es eine Wasseroberfläche.\nDann schritt sie hindurch und erschien wieder in ihrem Zimmer zu Hause."

      "Kamina ran as fast as she could. She was angry because she once again argued\nwith her brother Yoko. He'd taken away her beautiful music box. When she opened\nit, a little unicorn started dancing to an enchanting tune whose name she had\nunfortunately forgotten. The colorful wooden box with the dancing unicorn was\nthe dearest thing she owned.\n\nYoko was two years older than her. He had taken the musical clock away from her\nonce before. She remembered it clearly. It'd been on her last birthday when she\nturned six. Back then, Yoko had even broken a small corner off the dainty little\nbox with the dancing unicorn inside. But this time, she was prepared. She\nsnatched the clock right back out of his hand, kicked him in the shins, and ran\nas fast as she could. It served him right!\n\nThey were just on vacation at a campsite by the sea. The six-year-old liked it\nhere very much. Everything was green, covered with fuzzy shrubs. The girl\nespecially liked that there were plenty of rabbit holes everywhere. She'd\nalready met some of them this year.\n\nWhenever something was beautiful, her brother got wind of it quickly, got it out\nof her hands, and destroyed it. It was just the same on her birthday. In her\nanger, Kamina ran on and on. In the meantime, they'd already left behind two of\nthe long, dark hedges that grew between the meadows.\n\nShe was already passing the last tents at the edge of the campsite, and she'd\nalmost reached the stairs leading down to the beach when she saw someone hopping\non the ground in front of her. It was one of the rabbits! It must have been\nparticularly trusting: Kamina had never been this close to one of them ever\nbefore. Although her footsteps made quite a noise, it didn't seem to be afraid\nof her at all. The girl stopped to rest and breathe for a moment and decided to\ncreep cautiously from now on. She wanted to get closer to the little animal and\nfelt the instant urge to pet it. It hopped away and finally stopped in front of\nthe next hedge. Kamina was amazed. The rabbit seemed to be waiting for her!\n\nThe shrubs in the hedges were so thorny and dense that she couldn't squeeze\nthrough. But the animals that lived here had made sure that there were a few\ntrails. Kamina knew them pretty well by now. It was already her third time here.\n\nIt was strange, but suddenly, a passageway had formed out of the roots and\nbranches of the hedge where the rabbit was sitting now. It almost seemed like a\nsmall door.\n\n\"The perfect entrance for a rabbit hole,\"\n\nKamina thought to herself. Or had she pronounced it? She wasn't quite sure. And\nwhat was even stranger was that the rabbit had answered her! Or had she\nmisheard? Now, the rodent repeated its words.\n\n\"Come along!\" it said loud and clear. \"Yes, you there. You and your friend,\" the\nrabbit added.\n\n\"What friend?\" replied Kamina, perplexed. She couldn't believe that she was\ntalking to a rabbit. She'd only heard such things in stories. At that moment,\nthere was also a knock.\n\n\"Knock, knock.\"\n\nWhat could that be now? Then she realized that the knocking sound was coming\nfrom her music box. She opened the lid of the wooden box, but this time, no\nmusic came out. Of course, her brother immediately came back to her mind.\n\n\"This time, he broke my clock for good,\" she thought. But then she heard another\nvoice that sounded very softly.\n\n\"Hello Kamina, I'm Flox,\"\n\nThe girl didn't want to believe her eyes. The voice seemed to come from the\nlittle unicorn inside her clock.\n\n\"You are alive, and you can speak?\"\n\nKamina asked in a trembling tone. She was stunned. First, a rabbit talked to\nher, and now it became even stranger: Her favorite toy seemed to be a living\nbeing!\n\n\"Yes, Kamina. I'm here to take care of you.\"\n\n\"But how can that be?\"\n\nKamina had so many questions.\n\n\"I've always been looking out for you, my darling,\"\n\nthe colorful unicorn said to her.\n\n\"And I can do much more than just talk. Watch me.\"\n\nWith these words, the little fairy tale horse reared up briefly. Its fur started\nto glisten, and its horn shone in all rainbow colors. Then suddenly, it seemed\nto grow bigger and bigger. Kamina felt dizzy as she watched.\n\nSuddenly, she noticed something even stranger: The unicorn wasn't growing at\nall. Instead, she seemed to be getting smaller and smaller. At some point, she\nwas even barely taller than the rabbit! The next moment, she already fit through\nthe passage through which it had come out of the hedge. The unicorn was now\nstanding next to her. It was the size of a small pony but the graceful elegance\nof a noble gray horse.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of that, Kamina?\" said Flox. The unicorn's voice\nsounded much more profound and robust than the first time Kamina heard it.\n\n\"To be honest, it scares me a little,\"\n\nKamina replied shakily.\n\n\"Did you make me small? How will I ever get out of here?\"\n\nFlox reassured the girl:\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Kamina! I'll always be here for you. I promise you that\nnothing will happen to you and that you will be back in time for lunch.\"\n\nAs they walked along a shady, narrow passage between the thorny shrubs, he\nadded:\n\n\"You know, we need your help. The mermaids are in danger!\"\n\n\"The mermaids?\"\n\nKamina asked, puzzled.\n\nShe'd always dreamed of mermaids when they were on their vacation here. So, now\neverything pointed to the fact that they really existed? Judging by the crazy\nthings that had already happened to her today, of course, it had to be true! She\ncould hardly believe her luck. She might soon meet some real mermaids!\n\nFlox began to tell her about the inhabitants of the sea. He talked about the\nconversations the colorful fish had with each other, about the turtles and the\ngiant whales. Finally, he recounted about Queen Neptunia the Second. Kamina\nlearned he was the ruler of the water spirits and mermaids!\n\nAfter a long walk with many twists and turns and upsteps carved into the cliff\nrocks, they reached the sea. The water lapped in small glittering waves against\nthe bright sandy beach.\n\nKamina had the feeling that they had been walking for a very long time. When she\nlooked up, she had to rub her eyes. She almost didn't believe what she saw in\nthe sunlight.\n\nThe three hikers were in the middle of a shimmering pink sea. Thousands of\nflamingos stood row upon row in the shallow water. They were pecking at fish and\nplucking their feathers.\n\nOne of them, standing in the front row, had a strange hat on his head. It looked\nlike a helmet but seemed to be made of some leather. The long-legged bird also\nwore glasses on his forehead. At the moment, it probably didn't need them.\nKamina thought that perhaps the animal put them on to keep insects from flying\ninto its eyes while flying.\n\n\"What a funny flamingo,\" she thought. As if she had asked them about it, the\npink fluffy flamingo spoke to her.\n\n\"My name is River. I am the guardian of the great sea city, and these are my\nguards. Who are you, and what do you want?\" he added in a commanding-sounding\ntone.\n\nHaving shrunk, the water bird was more than three times the child's size. Flox\nnudged Kamina with his nostrils. With that, the unicorn simultaneously prompted\nher to say something, letting her know it still cared for its safety.\n\n\"My name is Kamina Sommerspitz,\"\n\nshe stammered.\n\n\"And I am Flox,\" the unicorn quickly added. \"We are already expected by Queen\nNeptunia the Second. We are here to offer our help.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" replied River incredulously. \"So it's you guys?\"\n\nHe made some quizzical head movements to the second flamingo behind him. The\nlatter immediately bent his long neck further back and whispered something in\nthe ear of one of the other birds. So it went on. Via the silent mail, the news\nhad soon reached the rearmost flamingos, and the game turned around. After a few\nseconds of awed silence, the second finally leaned over to River and whispered a\nreply.\n\n\"You may pass,\" the flamingo king said after some consideration. The flock\nparted in the middle, clearing a path leading directly into the sea.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" Flox told Kamina. \"If I or one of the water spirits is\nnearby, you can breathe normally underwater.\"\n\nFor a brief moment, Kamina was overcome with fear again. She had to think of her\nparents and the time that had already passed since she had discovered the rabbit\nupstairs. It had to be quite late. Surely, lunch had started long ago, and her\nfamily was already worried.\n\nBut she decided to be brave. What was happening here was just too exciting.\nThere was no way she was going to miss out on this adventure.\n\nSo, she took the first steps into the sea. Surprisingly, the water didn't seem\ncold to her at all. When they'd gone swimming here until now, it had always\ntaken quite a long time until she had dared to go in completely.\n\nOn the way to the sea city, Flox and River, who accompanied them, told the girl\nabout the problems in the underwater world.\n\n\"More and more plastic waste is cramping the houses and caves of the water\nspirits,\" Flox explained.\n\n\"The bags and bottles and fishing nets are a big danger. Last week, even the\ntower in the center of town collapsed. A net wrapped around it, and the current\nswept it away.\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\" asked Kamina. She had decided that she wanted to help—more\nthan anything in the world.\n\n\"Queen Neptunia will tell you,\" River replied. His voice sounded muffled because\nhis head was still above water. Kamina could only see his red legs at the\nmoment. The flamingo only dipped its head under sometimes to check on them.\n\nOnly now did she notice that the rabbit was no longer there. It had followed\nthem to the beach. Now, it seemed to have run back to its burrow. Strange.\nKamina had not noticed how it had said goodbye. Would she meet it again? She\nwould have liked to talk with it a little longer. After all, it was her favorite\nanimal, living in her favorite place.\n\nThe adventurers were now standing in front of a mighty wooden gate. It was\nmagnificently decorated and painted in all the colors of the sea. River dived\nunder once more and knocked briefly on the gate three times with his beak. The\ngate opened slowly. They entered the kingdom of the water spirits.\n\nKamina was amazed. They were standing at the entrance of a giant city. Hundreds\nof mermaids were buzzing around everywhere. With their long fish fins, they were\nthe best swimmers she had ever seen.\n\nAdults and children swam around behind, beside, and on top of each other. They\nwere going about their business. Some of the children had toys with them, just\nlike she did. Kamina was thrilled. Immediately, she too tried to dive around as\nhappily. But she soon discovered she couldn't be so fast and agile with her\nhuman legs—although she didn't think she was that clumsy. Mrs. Pütz, her\nswimming teacher, would undoubtedly have been proud of her.\n\nEven after this short time, she had been under the water's surface, her\nlocomotion was going well. Poor Flox continued to trot along the bottom. You\ncould tell that this was not his world. Suddenly Kamina saw a group of four\nyoung mermaids swimming towards her.\n\n\"Hello, who are you?\" the first child whispered disparagingly.\n\n\"I'm Neria,\" a shimmering green mermaid interjected in a much more polite tone.\nShe had probably noticed that the girl was a bit intimidated.\n\n\"This here is my sister Xiope and my brother Filipe. My brother Merlin over here\nhas already greeted you.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Kamina whispered. Her breath caught in admiration. \"My name is Kamina,\nKamina Sommerspitz. I'm human, and I was brought here by my friend Flox.\" Kamina\npointed backward.\n\nYou can't move that fast on the ground underwater, so the unicorn was still some\ndistance away.\n\n\"Ah, good old Flox,\" Neria said.\n\n\"You know him already?\" asked Kamina in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, of course! Everyone here knows Flox. He has helped us so many times.\nBesides, he's a good friend of our mother's.\"\n\n\"I see. I've only known Flox for a few hours, even though he's lived in my music\nbox for years.\"\n\n\"This sounds funny. You need to tell me about that sometime soon! But for now,\nlet's talk about us. We are four siblings, as you already know. Our mother is\nthe queen here.\"\n\nThe mermaid seemed to think it was necessary to introduce everyone in detail.\n\n\"Oh,\" Kamina replied. \"Queen Neptunia is your mother?\"\n\n\"That's right! We are all water spirits. They also call us mermaids or mermaids.\nBut that's a very old-fashioned term. We like ghosts better. That sounds much\nwilder. So how do you know our mother?\"\n\n\"Flox and River the Flamingo told me about her on the way here. I think they\nwant to take me to her.\"\n\nKamina told her story. She tried to sum up everything that had happened to her\non that strange day. She got along so well with the four water spirits that she\nforgot about time and became engrossed in the games and the stories they had in\nstore.\n\nAt some point, Flox appeared behind them. One of the adult water spirits was\nalso there.\n\n\"Kamina, what took you so long?\" neighed Flox, who was quite out of breath.\n\"I've been looking for you for half an eternity. We were going to the queen,\nweren't we? Don't forget your task, my darling!\"\n\nKamina felt guilty. Of course, the task! How could she forget it? She wanted to\ngo on an adventure and help the sea inhabitants with their plastic waste\nproblem.\n\n\"Come on, we'll go with you,\" Neria suggested. \"Let's pay mom a visit. I'm sure\nshe won't mind,\" she told her siblings.\n\nAnd so the group of six set off for the royal palace in the city's center. On\nthe way, they also passed a pile of rubble.\n\n\"This is where the great tower used to stand,\" Neria reported. Kamina got a\nproper fright. It was a sad sight.\n\nThe magnificent houses of the underwater city quickly reassured her. They were\neven more beautiful than she had imagined. The girl was especially thrilled by\nthe grand palace of the queen. When they reached it, her eyes sparkled. She had\nnever seen such a magnificent sparkling estate as the underwater palace.\n\n\"This is where we live,\" Neria said.\n\n\"This is incredible!\" Kamina marveled. The palace guards now accompanied them.\n\n\"I'll never find my way back alone,\" Kamina thought. They had swum through a\nveritable maze of corridors, halls, and side rooms and had just arrived at the\nqueen's throne room. The path through the palace and the alleys of the\nunderwater city back to the beach and through the bushes to the campsite seemed\nimpossible to her at that moment.\n\nBut she had quickly forgotten these thoughts. Her surroundings were just too\nbeautiful to worry about. The hall was so large that even at her average height,\nshe would have fit in without bumping her head.\n\n\"Step closer,\" she heard a warm, pleasant voice echo from across the hall.\n\nKamina took a few steps in the direction from which she had heard the words. As\nshe got closer, she saw a woman with short white hair sitting on the throne. It\nhad to be Queen Neptunia, Neria's, Xiope's, Filipe's, and Merlin's mother. She\nlooked like an absolute majesty. Kamina could see it in her posture. She was\nstunningly beautiful. The girl could only guess her age. She had tied her long\nwhite hair with a delicate coral hairband. Her white robe from which peeked out\nher magnificent tail fin, shimmering in all shades of blue and green.\n\n\"Hello, mama,\" called cheeky Merlin. He had already swum ahead.\n\n\"Well, who have you brought me?\" asked the queen in a motherly tone. Only as the\ngroup drew closer could Neptunia see the straggler.\n\n\"Flox, my old friend,\" she greeted the unicorn enthusiastically. She rose from\nher throne and swam toward him. \"It is my great pleasure to see you!\"\n\nThe two whispered a little among themselves. Kamina could not understand what\nthey were saying. Finally, they came up to her, too.\n\n\"This is Kamina, Kamina Sommerspitz of the humans,\" Flox introduced her. In a\nfairy tale movie once, Kamina had seen people do a yard curtsy when they met a\nqueen. Of course, this wasn't a fairy tale, but she thought it was the right\nthing to do. The queen began to laugh.\n\n\"We have dispensed with such courtesies down here for many millennia. Do they\nstill do it with you humans up there? A Knix? It's best if you just come here. I\nwelcome you to my castle! I see you have already met my children. I suppose\nthey've already shown you around?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Kamina replied. \"They are very kind to me.\"\n\n\"That pleases me to hear, my dear,\" replied the queen. \"Flox has already told me\na lot about you.\"\n\nKamina looked to the unicorn, who nodded her head reassuringly and\naffirmatively.\n\n\"Only the best,\" Flox neighed softly.\n\n\"I don't know if I can help you,\" the question finally blurted out of Kamina.\nShe had wanted to ask it all along.\n\n\"Hahaha,\" the queen laughed in her friendly and funny way. \"You bet you can,\nKamina!\" she replied. \"You have the gift. Flox told me weeks ago, and now I see\nit with my eyes. You have to believe in yourself. Come with me; I have to show\nyou something.\"\n\nWithout much hesitation, Queen Neptunia took Kamina aside. They swam to a\nquieter side area of the hall and took a seat on a bench made of shells. Flox\nfollowed them. The young water spirits continued playing in front of their\nmother's throne. They had discovered some toys there, which they had indeed left\nduring their last visit to the hall.\n\n\"Think of some toy,\" said the queen.\n\nKamina couldn't think of anything other than her brother's old beach ball.\nSuddenly, it landed right in her lap. She looked around, startled, and searched\nthe corners for her brother. There was nothing to be seen, however.\n\nKamina could think of nothing but her brother's old beach ball. Suddenly, it\nlanded right in her lap. She looked around, startled, and searched the corners\nfor her brother. There was nothing to be seen, however.\n\n\"Try it again. Take a gem this time.\"\n\nWith these words, Queen Neptunia took the ball from the girl and, with a strong\njolt, let it rise toward the ceiling. Kamina felt something cold around her neck\nand recognized the silver chain with the small amulet containing her parents'\npictures. Although she was sure she hadn't even taken it on vacation, it was\nsuddenly here.\n\n\"How do you do that?\" she asked the queen in amazement.\n\n\"Oh, I don't do anything,\" Neptunia replied. \"It's all coming from you. You\ncarry within you the rare gift of imagination. You can make things come true\nfrom your thoughts. You've always been able to do it, but the older you get, the\nbetter you can concentrate and the better it will work.\"\n\n\"Flox has already shown you what happened to our beautiful city. The great tower\nthat once rose to the sea's surface has recently collapsed. It got caught in a\nhuge fishing net. But that's only a small part of the problem. The whole city is\nstruggling with people's plastic waste. Even the fish outside our city walls and\nthe whole beach are affected. It's even killed some of us water spirits and\nseveral other sea creatures.\"\n\nKamina was affected. She desperately needed to protect this beautiful world she\nhad just discovered. She had to do everything to preserve it.\n\n\"All the townspeople are ready to help. But we need even more protection. You\ncan help us with your imagination. The task is simple and complicated at the\nsame time. Think of something that will keep the garbage away from our city but\nwill not harm the inhabitants of the sea. We tried it before with nets, but\nunfortunately, fish got caught in them. It was too dangerous for us.\"\n\nKamina closed her eyes and thought. She immediately thought of her dolls. She\nhad an exceptional one that she could grasp with her hands. She had also\nrecently gotten a small excavator that could extend its gripping arm. Her\nimagination was working like never before. She thought of the doll's arms\nfishing trash out of the current. Flox and the queen watched Kamina. They were\nboth smiling. It almost looked like they could see what was happening in the\nsix-year-old's mind. When Kamina opened her eyes again, she told them both about\nher idea.\n\nWhen they all swam back outside together, the whole town was already out.\nEveryone wanted to pitch in and help clear the underwater world and the beach of\ntrash. Kamina swam with Neria, Queen Neptunia, Felipe, Xiope, Merlin, and some\nof the guards to the outer areas of the city.\n\nThey were in the ocean current and were challenging to reach. To keep up with\nthe pace of the sea creatures, she was allowed to ride a large Napoleon fish\nalong with the unicorn. It was delightful, and Kamina squealed with delight a\nfew times.\n\nIn the meantime, she didn't even think about the time. She much preferred to\nthink about all the things she was going to build to help the creatures\nunderwater.\n\nThe Napoleon fish set her down on a flat rock. Once there, Kamina closed her\neyes again and continued to think. Neria and the others stood beside her and\nmarveled.\n\nAmong all the helpers from the city who were diving around and picking up trash,\nlarge, encrusted arms like moray eels suddenly emerged from the bottom of the\nsea out of nowhere. On them were strong hands that could grab anything, no\nmatter how heavy it was. They kept holding nets, plastic bottles, and bags. They\neven pulled out an old piece of a ship from the ocean's ground.\n\nAs time went on, there were more and more arms. There were so many, and they\nwere so long and strong that they could reach the whole underwater city and\nbeach. The grabbing arms worked faster and faster. The mountain of garbage grew.\n\nAfter everything was clean, Kamina was exhausted. Flox noticed it and took care\nof the brave girl. The unicorn called for departure, and so they all headed back\nto the sea city.\n\nKamina was surprised when they passed the massive pile of garbage on the beach\nthat her fantastic grasping arms had piled up. She quickly realized that it\ncouldn't stay here like this, so with the last of her strength, she remembered a\nhairy, orange caterpillar she had once seen. The little animal had been greedy\nand had eaten a substantial green leaf before her eyes.\n\nShe closed her eyes once more, and just a short moment later, a huge horde of\nhungry caterpillars descended on the mountain to eat it with great appetite.\nWhen the caterpillars had eaten everything, it became hushed around her. Their\ncolor changed. A rich orange became dark brown, and their previously shiny fur\ndisappeared. Instead, they were now covered in leathery skin. They had pupated.\nAgain, a moment later, life suddenly returned to the pupated caterpillars.\nThrough their thinning skin, a closer look revealed little legs and wings that\nseemed to move faster and faster: six legs and two wings in each pupa.\n\nSuddenly, the time had come. Hundreds of butterflies flew up: One more beautiful\nthan the other. They shimmered in the most brilliant colors.\n\n\"Kamina,\" said Neptunia, the second, when they finally arrived back at the great\ncastle gate. \"You saved our city. How can we ever thank you for that heroic\ndeed?\"\n\n\"May I come back sometime?\" asked Kamina.\n\n\"You are as welcome with us anytime as my children,\" replied the queen with\nflowing white hair.\n\nKamina looked at Neria, and they blinked at each other. As she strolled slowly\nback to the beach with Flox after an exuberant farewell in the royal house, she\nwas startled once more. She saw her brother splashing in the water in the\ndistance. When she looked closer, she realized that he wasn't splashing at all.\n\nHe was stuck with his foot in something. He must have gotten caught in a fishing\nnet. Have the grapplers forgotten about it? Kamina could sense his fear. She\nquickly summoned some of the water spirits. They had already been busy neatly\nsmoothing out the seaweed on which the pile of trash had been standing.\n\nCompared to her brother, Kamina and the water spirits were tiny. The boy kicked\ndesperately. But instead of loosening, his bonds only tightened. The water\nspirits began to loosen the fishing net with a few sharp shell shards. They had\nto be careful not to damage the skin of Kamina's brother Yoko.\n\nEventually, they managed to free him, and he could finally continue swimming.\nWhen he looked around and saw his sister's eyes, he shook his head in disbelief.\n\nTo him, it was just, like a fleeting moment, something tickling his foot. But\nsomething he had seen. Was that really Kamina? Why was she so small? And were\nthere colorful figures beside her in the water? He started to rub his eyes.\nThere was no way that could be.\n\nHe had gotten caught in something while frolicking in the water and was\nfrightened. Blaming it on his brief confusion, he turned his head away and kept\nswimming.\n\n\"The climb up to the campsite is strenuous,\" said Flox, who was now back on the\nbeach beside her, shaking out his mane. \"Not when you're as tall as a human,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" Kamina replied. \"Can you let me grow tall again, then?\"\n\nIt didn't take a minute, and Kamina had grown back to her usual size.\n\n\"You must have thought you were gone all day, didn't you?\" asked the unicorn.\n\"But you must know one thing: When you're small, time passes more slowly. Only\nhalf an hour has passed since I made you smaller.\"\n\nCompletely exhausted but overjoyed, Kamina strolled back down the path to the\ncampsite, which now didn't seem so long to her.\n\n\"Well, where did you come from?\" she greeted her mother. \"Lunch will be in a few\nminutes; you're all wet and dirty. Let's jump in the shower first, sweetheart.\"\n\nWhen Kamina and her mother returned from the shower house, lunch was already on\nthe table. Her father had cooked a delicious stew.\n\nMeanwhile, Yoko had also returned from the beach. Kamina briefly looked over at\nher brother and winked at him. Yoko was a little confused, but he understood\nwhat she was trying to say and nodded back at her with a grin."

      "Kamina rannte, so schnell sie konnte. Sie war wütend, weil sie sich mal wieder\nmit ihrem Bruder gestritten hatte. Er hatte ihr ihre schöne Spieluhr\nweggenommen. Wenn man sie öffnete, tanzte ein kleines Einhorn nach einer\nbezaubernden Melodie, deren Namen sie leider vergessen hatte. Das bunte\nHolzkästchen mit dem tanzenden Einhorn war ihr das Liebste, was sie besaß.\n\nIhr Bruder Yoko war zwei Jahre älter als sie. Er hatte ihr die Uhr schon einmal\nweggenommen. Sie erinnerte sich genau daran. Es war an ihrem letzten Geburtstag\ngewesen, als sie sechs Jahre alt geworden war. Yoko hatte damals sogar eine\nkleine Ecke von dem zierlichen Kästchen mit dem tanzenden Einhorn darin\nabgebrochen. Diesmal war sie vorbereitet. Sie riss ihm die Uhr sofort wieder aus\nder Hand, trat ihm gegen das Schienbein und rannte so schnell sie konnte los.\nDas geschah ihm recht!\n\nSie waren gerade im Urlaub auf einem Campingplatz am Meer. Eigentlich gefiel es\nder Sechs‐jährigen hier ausgezeichnet. Alles war grün und mit Büschen bedeckt.\nWas ihr besonders gefiel, war, dass es hier überall Löcher gab, in denen\nKaninchen wohnten. In diesem Jahr war sie schon zweimal welchen begegnet!\n\nImmer wenn etwas schön war, musste ihr Bruder kommen und alles zerstören. Das\nwar an ihrem Geburtstag genauso gewesen. Das Mädchen rannte vor Wut weiter und\nweiter. Inzwischen hatten sie bereits zwei der langen dunklen Hecken hinter sich\ngelassen, die hier zwischen den Wiesen wuchsen. Sie kam jetzt schon an den\nletzten Zelten am Rande des Campingplatzes vorbei.\n\nSie war fast an der Treppe angekommen, die zum Strand hinunterführte, als sie\nauf dem Boden vor sich jemanden hoppeln sah. Es war eines der Kaninchen! Es war\nwohl besonders zutraulich, denn so nah, war Kamina noch an keines von ihnen\nherangekommen. Obwohl ihre Schritte einen ziemlichen Lärm machten, schien es gar\nkeine Angst vor ihr zu haben. Das Mädchen blieb kurz stehen, um innezuhalten.\n\nSie beschloss, ab jetzt lieber vorsichtig zu schleichen, um sich dem Tierchen\netwas besser nähern zu können. Sie wollte es einfach zu gerne streicheln. Es\nhoppelte davon und blieb schließlich vor der nächsten Hecke stehen. Kamina war\nverwundert. Das Tier schien auf sie zu warten!\n\nDie Sträucher in den Hecken waren so dornig und dicht, dass man sich nicht\neinfach so hindurchzwängen konnte. Die Tiere, die hier lebten, hatten aber dafür\ngesorgt, dass es ein paar Trampelpfade gab. Kamina kannte sie inzwischen\nziemlich gut. Sie sind nun schon zum dritten Mal hier.\n\nDort, wo das Kaninchen jetzt saß, hatte sich aus den Wurzeln und Ästen der Hecke\nein Durchgang gebildet. Er wirkte fast wie eine kleine Tür.\n\n„Der perfekte Eingang für einen Kaninchenbau“,\n\ndachte Kamina bei sich. Oder hatte sie es ausgesprochen? Sie war sich nicht ganz\nsicher. Und was noch viel merkwürdiger war: Das Kaninchen hatte ihr geantwortet!\nOder hatte sie sich verhört? Jetzt wiederholte das Nagetier seine Worte.\n\n„Komm mit!“\n\nsagte es laut und deutlich.\n\n„Ja, Du da. Du und Dein Freund“, fügte das Kaninchen hinzu.\n\n„Welcher Freund?“\n\nantwortete Kamina perplex. Sie konnte gar nicht glauben, dass sie mit einem\nKaninchen sprach. So was kannte sie bis jetzt nur aus Geschichten. In diesem\nMoment klopfte es auch noch.\n\n„Klopf, klopf.“\n\nWas mochte das nun schon wieder sein? Da bemerkte sie, dass die Klopfgeräusche\naus ihrer Spieluhr kam. Sie öffnete den Deckel der Holzschachtel, doch diesmal\nkam keine Musik heraus. Natürlich kam ihr sofort wieder ihr Bruder in den Sinn.\n\n„Dieses Mal hat er meine Uhr endgültig zerstört“,\n\ndachte sie. Doch da hörte sie eine weitere Stimme.\n\n„Hallo Kamina, ich bin Flox“,\n\nklang es leise in Kaminas Ohren. Sie wollte ihren Augen nicht trauen. Die Stimme\nschien von dem kleinen Einhorn in der Uhr zu kommen.\n\n„Du bist am Leben und Du kannst sprechen?“\n\nfragte Kamina mit zitterndem Ton. Sie war überwältigt. Erst redete ein Kaninchen\nmit ihr und nun auch noch ihr Lieblingsspielzeug.\n\n„Ja, Kamina. Ich bin hier, um auf Dich aufzupassen.“\n\n„Aber, aber.“\n\nKamina stockte. Sie hatte plötzlich so viele Fragen.\n\n„Aber wie kann das denn sein?“\n\n„Ich habe schon immer auf Dich aufgepasst, mein Schatz“,\n\nsagte das bunte Einhorn.\n\n„Und ich kann noch viel mehr, als nur reden. Pass mal auf.“\n\nMit diesen Worten bäumte sich das Pferdchen kurz auf. Sein Fell glitzerte und\nsein Horn begann in allen Regenbogenfarben zu leuchten. Dann schien es plötzlich\nimmer größer zu werden. Kamina wurde beim Zusehen ganz schwindelig.\n\nPlötzlich fiel ihr etwas noch viel Seltsameres auf: Das Einhorn wuchs gar nicht.\nStattdessen wurde sie immer kleiner. Irgendwann war sie kaum noch größer als das\nKaninchen. Im nächsten Moment passte sie schon durch den Durchgang, durch den es\naus der Hecke gekommen war. Das Einhorn stand jetzt neben ihr. Es hatte die\nGröße eines kleinen Ponys, aber die grazile Eleganz eines edlen Schimmels.\n\n„Na, wie findest Du das, Kamina?“\n\nfragte Flox. Die Stimme des Einhorns klang jetzt viel tiefer und kräftiger als\nbeim ersten Mal.\n\n„Es macht mir ein bisschen Angst“,\n\nantwortete Kamina.\n\n„Du hast mich klein gemacht. Wie komme ich denn hier jemals wieder raus?“\n\n„Hab keine Angst, Kamina!“\n\nberuhigte Flox das Mädchen. „Ich bin immer für Dich da. Ich verspreche Dir, dass\nDir nichts passieren wird und Du rechtzeitig zum Mittagessen wieder zurück\nbist.“\n\n„Weißt Du, wir brauchen Deine Hilfe“,\n\nergänzte Flox, während sie einen schattigen, engen Durchgang zwischen den\ndornigen Büschen entlangliefen.\n\n„Die Meerjungfrauen sind in Gefahr.“\n\n„Die Meerjungfrauen?“\n\nfragte Kamina verblüfft.\n\nKamina hatte immer von Meerjungfrauen geträumt, wenn sie hier im Urlaub waren.\nEs schien sie also wirklich zu geben? Gemessen an den verrückten Dingen, die ihr\nheute schon passiert waren, musste das natürlich wahr sein. Sie konnte ihr Glück\nkaum fassen. Sie würde vielleicht schon bald ein paar echten Meerjungfrauen\nbegegnen.\n\nFlox fing an, von den Bewohnern des Meeres zu erzählen. Er berichtete von den\nGesprächen, die die bunten Fische miteinander führten. Von den Schildkröten und\nden großen Walen. Schließlich erzählte er von Königin Neptunia der Zweiten. So\nhieß die Herrscherin über die Wassergeister und Meerjungfrauen.\n\nNach einem langen Fußmarsch mit vielen Biegungen und Abzweigungen und über\nTreppenstufen, die in die Felsenklippen gehauen waren, erreichten sie das Meer.\nDas Wasser plätscherte in kleinen glitzernden Wellen gegen den hellen\nSandstrand.\n\nKamina hatte das Gefühl, dass sie schon sehr lange unterwegs waren. Als sie\naufsah, musste sie sich erst mal die Augen reiben. Fast hätte sie nicht\ngeglaubt, was sie im hellen Sonnenlicht vor sich sah.\n\nDie drei Wandernden befanden sich mitten in einem pink schimmernden Meer.\nTausende Flamingos standen Reihe an Reihe hintereinander im flachen Wasser. Sie\npickten nach Fischen und zupften sich das Gefieder.\n\nEiner aus der vordersten Reihe hatte einen merkwürdigen Hut auf dem Kopf. Er sah\naus wie ein Helm, schien aber aus einer Art Leder zu bestehen. Außerdem trug der\nVogel eine Brille auf der Stirn. Momentan brauchte er sie wohl nicht. Kamina\ndachte, dass das Tier sie vielleicht aufsetzte, damit ihm beim Fliegen keine\nInsekten in die Augen flogen.\n\n„Was für ein komischer Flamingo“,\n\ndachte sie. Als hätte sie ihn danach gefragt, sprach dieser zu ihr.\n\n„Mein Name ist River. Ich bin der Wächter der großen Meeresstadt und das hier\nsind meine Wachen. Wer seid Ihr und was wollt ihr?“\n\nfügte er in gebieterischem Ton hinzu.\n\nDa sie geschrumpft waren, war der Wasservogel mehr als dreimal so groß wie das\nKind. Flox stupste Kamina mit seinen Nüstern an. Das Einhorn forderte sie damit\ngleichzeitig dazu auf, etwas zu sagen, und gab ihr zu verstehen, dass es nach\nwie vor für seine Sicherheit sorgte.\n\n„Mein Name ist Kamina Sommerspitz“,\n\nstotterte sie.\n\n„Und ich bin Flox“,\n\nfügte das Einhorn schnell hinzu.\n\n„Wir werden schon von Königin Neptunia, der Zweiten, erwartet. Wir sind hier, um\nunsere Hilfe anzubieten.“\n\n„Ist das so?“\n\nentgegnete River ungläubig.\n\n„Ihr seid das also?“\n\nEr machte einige komische Kopfbewegungen zu dem zweiten Flamingo hinter ihm.\nDieser beugte sich sogleich mit seinem langen Hals weiter zurück und flüsterte\neinem der anderen Vögel etwas ins Ohr. So ging es weiter. Über die stille Post\nhatte die Nachricht bald die hintersten Flamingos erreicht und das Spiel drehte\nsich um. Nach einigen Sekunden betretenen Schweigens beugte sich der flauschige,\npinkfarbene Flamingo schließlich zu River vor und flüsterte ihm eine Antwort zu.\n\n„Ihr dürft passieren“,\n\nsagte er nach kurzer Überlegung. Die Schar der Flamingos teilte sich in der\nMitte und machte einen Weg frei, der direkt ins Meer führte.\n\n„Keine Angst“,\n\nsagte Flox zu Kamina.\n\n„Wenn ich oder einer der Wassergeister in der Nähe ist, kannst Du unter Wasser\nganz normal atmen.“\n\nFür einen kurzen Moment überkam Kamina wieder die Angst. Sie musste an ihre\nEltern denken und die Zeit, die schon verstrichen war, seit sie oben das\nKaninchen entdeckt hatte. Es musste schon ziemlich spät sein. Sicher hatte das\nMittagessen längst angefangen. Bestimmt machte sich ihre Familie bereits Sorgen.\n\nDoch sie beschloss, mutig zu sein. Was hier passierte, war einfach zu aufregend.\nSie konnte sich dieses Abenteuer auf keinen Fall entgehen lassen.\n\nSo machte sie die ersten Schritte ins Meer. Erstaunlicherweise kam ihr das\nWasser gar nicht kalt vor. Wenn sie bis jetzt hier schwimmen gegangen waren,\nhatte es immer ganz schön lange gedauert, bis sie sich ganz hineingetraut hatte.\n\nAuf dem Weg zur Meeresstadt erzählten Flox und River, der sie begleitete, dem\nMädchen von den Problemen in der Unterwasserwelt.\n\n„In den Häusern und Höhlen der Wassergeister sammelt sich immer mehr\nPlastikmüll“,\n\nerklärte Flox. „Die Tüten und Flaschen und Fischernetze sind eine große Gefahr.\nVergangene Woche ist sogar der Turm im Stadtzentrum eingestürzt. Ein Netz hat\nsich einfach so um ihn herumgewickelt und er wurde von der Strömung davon\ngerissen.“\n\n„Aber was kann ich denn da tun?“\n\nfragte Kamina, die wirklich gerne helfen wollte.\n\n„Königin Neptunia wird es Dir erzählen“,\n\nantwortete River. Seine Stimme klang dumpf, weil sich sein Kopf noch über Wasser\nbefand. Kamina konnte im Moment nur seine roten Beine sehen. Der Flamingo\ntauchte den Kopf nur manchmal unter, um nach ihnen zu sehen.\n\nErst jetzt fiel ihr auf, dass das Kaninchen nicht mehr da war. Bis zum Strand\nwar es ihnen noch gefolgt. Nun schien es wieder zu seinem Bau zurückgelaufen zu\nsein. Komisch, Kamina hatte gar nicht gemerkt, wie es sich verabschiedet hatte.\nOb sie es noch mal treffen würde? Sie hätte sich gerne noch etwas länger mit ihm\nunterhalten. Schließlich war es ihr Lieblingstier, das an ihrem Lieblingsort\nlebte.\n\nDie Abenteurer standen nun vor einem mächtigen Holztor. Es war prächtig verziert\nund in allen Farben des Meeres bemalt. River tauchte noch einmal unter und\npochte mit seinem Schnabel dreimal kurz an die Pforte. Das Tor öffnete sich\nlangsam. Sie betraten das Königreich der Wassergeister.\n\nKamina staunte nicht schlecht. Sie standen am Eingang einer riesigen Stadt.\nHunderte Meerjungfrauen schwirrten überall herum. Mit ihren langen Fischflossen\nwaren sie die besten Schwimmer, die sie jemals gesehen hatte.\n\nErwachsene und Kinder schwammen hinter-, neben- und übereinander herum. Sie\ngingen ihren Beschäftigungen nach. Einige der Kinder hatten genau wie sie\nSpielzeug dabei. Kamina war begeistert. Sofort versuchte auch sie, so fröhlich\numherzutauchen. Doch sie musste schnell feststellen, dass sie mit ihren\nmenschlichen Beinen nicht ganz so schnell und wendig sein konnte – obwohl sie\nsich gar nicht so ungeschickt anstellte, wie sie fand. Frau Pütz, ihre\nSchwimmlehrerin, wäre sicher stolz auf sie gewesen.\n\nSchon nach der kurzen Zeit, die sie jetzt unter der Wasseroberfläche war,\nklappte es mit der Fortbewegung bestens. Der arme Flox trabte weiterhin am Boden\nentlang. Man konnte es ihm ansehen, dass das hier nicht seine Welt war. Auf\neinmal sah Kamina eine Vierergruppe junger Meerjungfrauen auf sie zu schwimmen.\n\n„Hallo, wer bist Du denn?“\n\nwisperte das erste Kind etwas abschätzig.\n\n„Ich bin Neria“,\n\nmischte sich eine grünlich schimmernde Meerjungfrau in einem deutlich\nhöflicheren Ton ein. Sie hatte wohl bemerkt, dass das Mädchen etwas\neingeschüchtert war.\n\n„Das hier sind meine Schwester Xiope und mein Bruder Filipe. Mein Bruder Merlin\nhier drüben hat Dich ja schon begrüßt.“\n\n„Hallo“,\n\nflüsterte Kamina. Ihr stockte der Atem vor Bewunderung.\n\n„Mein Name ist Kamina, Kamina Sommerspitz. Ich bin ein Mensch und wurde von\nmeinem Freund Flox hier hergebracht.“ Kamina deutete nach hinten.\n\nUnter Wasser kommt man auf dem Boden nicht so schnell voran, deshalb befand sich\ndas Einhorn noch etwas entfernt.\n\n„Ach, der gute alte Flox“,\n\nsagte Neria.\n\n„Du kennst ihn schon?“\n\nfragte Kamina überrascht.\n\n„Ja natürlich! Jeder hier kennt Flox. Er hat uns schon so oft geholfen. Außerdem\nist er ein enger Freund unserer Mutter.“\n\n„Ach so! Ich kenne ihn erst seit ein paar Stunden, obwohl er schon seit ein paar\nJahren in meiner Spieluhr wohnt.“\n\n„Was? Das verstehe ich nicht. Das musst Du mir bald einmal genauer erzählen.\nAber jetzt erst mal zu uns. Wir sind vier Geschwister, wie Du schon weißt.\nUnsere Mutter ist hier die Königin.“\n\nDer Nixe schien es wichtig zu sein, alle genau vorzustellen.\n\n„Ach“,\n\nentgegnete Kamina.\n\n„Königin Neptunia ist Eure Mutter?“\n\n„Ja genau! Wir alle sind Wassergeister. Auch Nixen genannt, oder Meerjungfrauen.\nAber das ist ein sehr altmodischer Begriff. Wir mögen Geister lieber. Das klingt\nviel wilder. Woher kennst Du unsere Mutter denn?“\n\n„Flox und River, der Flamingo, haben mir auf dem Weg hierher von ihr erzählt.\nIch glaube, sie möchten mich zu ihr bringen.“\n\nKamina erzählte ihre Geschichte. Sie versucht, alles zusammenzufassen, was ihr\nbisher an diesem seltsamen Tag passiert war. Mit den vier Wassergeistern\nverstand sie sich so gut, dass sie die Zeit vergaß und sich in die Spiele und\ndie Geschichten vertiefte, die sie auf Lager hatten.\n\nIrgendwann tauchten Flox hinter ihnen auf. Einer der erwachsenen Wassergeister\nwar auch dabei.\n\n„Kamina, wo warst Du denn so lange“,\n\nwieherte Flox, der ziemlich aus der Puste war.\n\n„Ich suche Dich schon seit einer halben Ewigkeit. Wir wollten doch zur Königin.\nVergiss Deine Aufgabe nicht, mein Schatz!“\n\nKamina hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen. Natürlich, die Aufgabe! Wie konnte sie die\nnur vergessen? Sie wollte doch ein Abenteuer bestehen und den Bewohnern des\nMeeres bei ihrem Problem mit dem Plastikmüll helfen.\n\n„Komm, wir begleiten Dich“,\n\nschlug Neria kurzerhand vor.\n\n„Lasst uns Mama einen Besuch abstatten. Sie hat sicher nichts dagegen“, sagte\nsie zu ihren Geschwistern.\n\nUnd so machte sich die Sechsergruppe auf den Weg zum Königspalast in der Mitte\nder Stadt. Auf dem Weg dorthin kamen sie auch an einem Trümmerhaufen vorbei.\n\n„Hier hat der große Turm gestanden“,\n\nberichtete Neria. Kamina bekam einen gehörigen Schrecken. Das war ein trauriger\nAnblick.\n\nDie prächtigen Häuser der Unterwasserstadt beruhigten sie schnell wieder. Sie\nwaren noch schöner, als sie sie sich vorgestellt hatte. Besonders begeistert war\ndas Mädchen vom großen Palast der Königin. Als sie ihn erreichten, strahlten\nihre Augen. Sie hatte noch nie in ihrem Leben ein so prächtig funkelndes Anwesen\ngesehen wie den Unterwasser-Palast.\n\n„Hier wohnen wir“,\n\nsagte Neria.\n\n„Das ist traumhaft!“\n\nstaunte Kamina. Sie wurden jetzt von den Palastwachen begleitet.\n\n„Allein finde ich nie wieder zurück“,\n\ndachte Kamina. Sie waren durch ein wahres Gewirr aus Gängen, Sälen und\nNebenzimmern geschwommen und eben im Thronsaal der Königin angekommen. Der Weg\ndurch den Palast und die Gassen der Unterwasserstadt zurück an den Strand und\ndurch die Gebüsche bis zum Campingplatz schien ihr in diesem Moment\nunüberwindbar.\n\nDoch diese Gedanken hatte sie schnell wieder vergessen. Ihre Umgebung war\neinfach zu schön, um sich Sorgen zu machen. Der Saal war so groß, dass sie sogar\nin ihrer normalen Größe hineingepasst hätte, ohne sich den Kopf zu stoßen.\n\n„Tretet näher“,\n\nhörte sie eine warme, angenehme Stimme von der anderen Seite des Saals herüber\nhallen. Das Echo wurde von allen Wänden zurückgeworfen.\n\nKamina ging ein paar Schritte in die Richtung, aus der sie die Worte gehört\nhatte. Als sie näherkam, sah sie eine Frau mit kurzem weißem Haar auf dem Thron\nsitzen. Das musste Königin Neptunia sein, Nerias, Xiopes, Filipes und Merlins\nMutter. Sie sah aus, wie eine richtige Majestät. Kamina sah es schon an ihrer\nKörperhaltung. Sie war bildschön und ihr Alter konnte man nur erahnen. Sie hatte\nlanges weißes Haar, das von einem zarten Korallenhaarreif gehalten wurde. Sie\ntrug ein weißes Gewand, aus dem die prächtige, in allen Blau- und Grüntönen\nschimmernde Schwanzflosse herausschaute.\n\n„Hallo, Mama“,\n\nrief der freche Merlin. Er war schon voraus geschwommen.\n\n„Na, wen habt Ihr mir denn da mitgebracht?“\n\nfragte die Königin in mütterlichem Ton. Erst als die Gruppe näher herankam,\nkonnte Neptunia den Nachzügler sehen.\n\n„Flox, mein alter Freund“,\n\nbegrüßte sie das Einhorn begeistert. Sie stand von ihrem Thron auf und schwamm\nihm entgegen. „Es ist mir eine große Freude, Dich zu sehen!“\n\nDie beiden tuschelten ein wenig untereinander. Kamina konnte nicht verstehen,\nwas sie sagten. Schließlich kamen sie auch auf sie zu.\n\n„Das ist Kamina, Kamina Sommerspitz von den Menschen“,\n\nstellte Flox sie vor. In einem Märchenfilm hatte Kamina einmal gesehen, dass die\nLeute einen Knicks machten, wenn sie einer Königin begegneten. Natürlich war das\nhier kein Märchen, aber sie hielt es für das Richtige, es auch zu tun. Die\nKönigin begann zu lachen.\n\n„Auf solche Höflichkeitsfloskeln verzichten wir hier unten schon seit vielen\nJahrtausenden. Macht man das bei Euch Menschen da oben immer noch? Einen Knicks?\nKomm am besten einfach her. Ich heiße Dich herzlich willkommen in meinem\nSchloss! Wie ich sehe, hast Du meine Kinder bereits kennengelernt? Ich nehme an,\nsie haben Dich schon herumgeführt?“\n\n„Ja“,\n\nantwortete Kamina.\n\n„Sie sind sehr nett zu mir.“\n\n„Das freut mich zu hören, meine Liebe“,\n\nantwortete die Königin.\n\n„Flox hat mir schon viel von Dir erzählt.“\n\nKamina schaute zu dem Einhorn, das beruhigend und bestätigend mit dem Kopf\nnickte.\n\n„Nur das Beste“,\n\nwieherte Flox leise.\n\n„Ich weiß nicht, ob ich Euch helfen kann“,\n\nplatzte die Frage schließlich aus Kamina heraus. Sie hatte sie schon die ganze\nZeit stellen wollen.\n\n„Hahaha“,\n\nlachte die Königin auf ihre freundliche und lustige Art.\n\n„Und ob Du das kannst, Kamina!“\n\nantwortete sie.\n\n„Du hast die Gabe dazu. Flox hat es mir schon vor Wochen erzählt und jetzt sehe\nich es mit eigenen Augen. Du musst nur an Dich glauben. Komm mal mit, ich muss\nDir etwas zeigen.“\n\nOhne lange zu zögern, nahm Königin Neptunia Kamina zur Seite. Sie schwammen in\neinen ruhigeren Seitenbereich des Saals und nahmen auf einer Bank aus Muscheln\nPlatz. Flox folgte ihnen. Die jungen Wassergeister spielten vor dem Thron ihrer\nMutter weiter. Sie hatten dort ein paar Spielsachen entdeckt, die sie sicher bei\nihrem letzten Besuch im Saal dort liegen gelassen hatten.\n\n„Denke an irgendein Spielzeug“,\n\nsagte die Königin.\n\nKamina fiel nichts anderes ein, als der alte Wasserball ihres Bruders. Plötzlich\nlandete er direkt in ihrem Schoß. Sie sah sich erschrocken um und suchte die\nEcken nach ihrem Bruder ab. Es war aber nichts zu sehen.\n\n„Probier es noch einmal. Nimm dieses Mal ein Schmuckstück.“\n\nMit diesen Worten nahm Königin Neptunia dem Mädchen den Ball ab und ließ ihn mit\neinem kräftigen Ruck in Richtung Decke aufsteigen. Kamina spürte etwas Kaltes um\nihren Hals und erkannte die Silberkette mit dem kleinen Amulett, in dem die\nBilder ihrer Eltern steckten. Obwohl sie sich sicher war, dass sie es nicht mal\nmit in den Urlaub genommen hatte, war es plötzlich hier.\n\n„Wie machst Du das?“\n\nfragte sie die Königin erstaunt.\n\n„Oh, ich mache gar nichts“,\n\nentgegnete Neptunia.\n\n„Das kommt alles von Dir. Du trägst die seltene Gabe der Fantasie in Dir. Du\nkannst die Dinge aus Deinen Gedanken wahr werden lassen. Du konntest es schon\nimmer, aber je älter du wirst, desto besser kannst Du Dich konzentrieren und\ndesto besser wird es funktionieren.“\n\n„Flox hat Dir ja schon gezeigt, was mit unserer schönen Stadt passiert ist. Der\ngroße Turm, der einst bis zur Meeresoberfläche ragte, ist vor Kurzem\neingestürzt. Er hat sich in einem riesigen Fischernetz verfangen. Aber das ist\nnur ein kleiner Teil des Problems. Die ganze Stadt hat mit dem Plastikmüll der\nMenschen zu kämpfen. Auch die Fische außerhalb unserer Stadtmauern und der ganze\nStrand sind davon betroffen. Es sind sogar schon einige von uns Wassergeistern\nund ganz viele andere Meeresbewohner daran gestorben.“\n\nKamina war betroffen. Sie musste diese schöne Welt, die sie gerade erst entdeckt\nhatte, dringend beschützen. Sie durfte nicht verloren gehen.\n\n„Alle in der Stadt sind bereit, zu helfen. Aber wir brauchen noch mehr Schutz.\nDu kannst uns mit Deiner Fantasie helfen. Die Aufgabe ist einfach und\nkompliziert zugleich. Denk Dir etwas aus, das den Müll von unserer Stadt fern\nhält, den Bewohnern des Meeres jedoch nicht schadet. Wir haben es schon einmal\nmit Netzen versucht, aber leider haben sich Fische darin verfangen. Das war uns\nzu gefährlich.“\n\nKamina schloss ihre Augen und überlegte. Sie musste sofort an ihre Puppen\ndenken. Sie hatte eine ganz besondere Puppe, die mit ihren Händen greifen\nkonnte. Außerdem hatte sie vor Kurzem einen kleinen Bagger geschenkt bekommen,\nder seinen Greifarm verlängern konnte. Ihre Fantasie arbeitete, wie noch nie\nzuvor. Sie dachte daran, wie die Arme der Puppe den Abfall aus der Strömung\nheraus fischten. Flox und die Königin sahen Kamina zu. Sie lächelten beide. Es\nsah fast so aus, als könnten sie erkennen, was sich im Kopf der Sechsjährigen\nabspielte. Als Kamina ihre Augen wieder öffnete, erzählte sie den beiden von\nihrer Idee.\n\nAls sie alle gemeinsam wieder nach draußen schwammen, war bereits die ganze\nStadt unterwegs. Alle wollten mit anpacken und die Unterwasserwelt und den\nStrand vom Müll befreien. Kamina schwamm mit Neria, Königin Neptunia, Felipe,\nXiope, Merlin und einigen der Wachen bis in die Außenbereiche der Stadt.\n\nSie lagen in der Meeresströmung und waren nicht so leicht zu erreichen. Um mit\ndem Tempo der Meeresbewohner mithalten zu können, durfte sie zusammen mit dem\nEinhorn auf einem großen Napoleonfisch reiten. Das machte unglaublich viel Spaß\nund Kamina quietsche ein paar Mal vor Freude.\n\nAn die Uhrzeit dachte sie inzwischen gar nicht mehr. Sie dachte viel lieber\ndaran, was sie alles aufbauen wollte, um den Lebewesen unter Wasser zu helfen.\n\nDer Napoleonfisch setzte sie auf einem flachen Felsen ab. Dort angekommen,\nmachte Kamina die Augen wieder zu und überlegte weiter. Neria und die anderen\nstanden neben ihr und staunten.\n\nZwischen all den Helfern aus der Stadt, die umher tauchten und Müll\naufsammelten, tauchten aus dem Nichts plötzlich große, verkrustete Arme wie\nMuränen aus dem Meeresgrund auf. An ihnen befanden sich starke Hände, die alles\ngreifen konnten, egal, wie schwer es war. Sie griffen immer wieder nach Netzen,\nPlastikflaschen und Tüten. Selbst ein altes Stück eines Schiffs schnappten sie\naus dem Meer.\n\nMit der Zeit wurden es mehr und mehr Arme. Es waren so viele und sie waren so\nlang und stark, dass sie die ganze Unterwasserstadt und den gesamten Strand\nerreichen konnten. Die Greifarme arbeiteten immer schneller. Der Müllberg wuchs.\n\nNachdem alles sauber war, war Kamina erschöpft. Flox bemerkte es und kümmerte\nsich um das mutige Mädchen. Das Einhorn rief zum Aufbruch und so machten sich\nalle auf den Rückweg in die Meeresstadt.\n\nKamina wahr überrascht, als sie an dem riesengroßen Müllberg am Strand\nvorbeikamen, den ihre fantastischen Greifarme aufgestapelt hatten. Schnell wurde\nihr klar, dass er hier nicht so liegen bleiben könnte und so erinnerte sie sich\nmit letzter Kraft an eine haarige, orangefarbene Raupe, die sie einmal gesehen\nhatte. Das kleine Tierchen war sehr gefräßig gewesen und hatte vor ihren Augen\nein riesiges, grünes Blatt verspeist.\n\nSie schloss noch einmal ihre Augen und schon einen kurzen Moment später machte\nsich eine riesige Horde hungriger Raupen über den Berg her, um ihn mit großem\nAppetit zu verspeisen. Als die Raupen alles aufgefressen hatten, wurde es ganz\nstill um sie herum. Ihre Farbe veränderte sich. Aus einem satten Orange wurde\ndunkles Braun und ihr vorher so glänzendes Fell verschwand. Stattdessen waren\nsie jetzt von einer ledrigen Haut überzogen. Sie hatten sich verpuppt. Wieder\neinen Augenblick später kehrte plötzlich Leben in die verpuppten Raupen. Durch\nihre jetzt dünner werdende Haut konnte man bei genauerem Hinsehen Beinchen und\nFlügel erkennen, die sich immer schneller zu bewegen schienen. Sechs Beinchen\nund zwei Flügel in jeder Puppe.\n\nPlötzlich war es so weit: Hunderte Schmetterlinge flogen auf. Einer schöner als\nder andere. Sie schimmerten in den buntesten Farben.\n\n„Kamina“,\n\nsagte Neptunia, die Zweite, als sie schließlich wieder am großen Schlosstor\nangekommen waren. „Du hast unsere Stadt gerettet. Wie können wir Dir nur jemals\nfür diese Heldentat danken?“\n\n„Darf ich irgendwann einmal wiederkommen?“\n\nfragte Kamina.\n\n„Du bist bei uns jederzeit genauso willkommen, wie meine eigenen Kinder“,\n\nantwortete die Königin mit ihrem wallenden, weißen Haar.\n\nKamina blickte zu Neria und sie blinzelten einander zu. Als sie nach einem\nüberschwänglichen Abschied im Königshaus gemeinsam mit Flox langsam zurück zum\nStrand schlenderte, schreckte sie noch einmal auf. Sie sah in der Ferne ihren\nBruder im Wasser planschen. Als sie genauer hinsah, merkte sie, dass er gar\nnicht planschte.\n\nEr steckte mit dem Fuß in etwas fest. Er musste sich in einem Fischernetz\nverfangen haben. Ob die Greifer es vergessen hatten? Kamina konnte seine Angst\nspüren. Sie rief schnell einige der Wassergeister herbei. Sie waren schon damit\nbeschäftigt gewesen, das Seegras, auf dem der Müllberg gestanden hatte, wieder\nordentlich zu glätten.\n\nIm Vergleich zu ihrem Bruder waren Kamina und die Wassergeister winzig klein.\nDer Junge strampelte verzweifelt. Doch statt sich zu lösen, zogen sich seine\nFesseln nur immer fester. Die Wassergeister machten sich ans Werk, das\nFischernetz mit ein paar scharfen Muschelscherben zu lösen. Dabei mussten sie\nvorsichtig sein, um die Haut von Kaminas Bruder Yoko nicht zu verletzen.\n\nSchließlich schafften sie es, ihn zu befreien und er konnte endlich wieder wie\ngewohnt weiter schwimmen. Als er sich umblickte und in die Augen seiner\nSchwester sah, schüttelte er ungläubig den Kopf.\n\nFür ihn war es nur, wie ein flüchtiger Augenblick, in dem etwas an seinem Fuß\nkitzelte. Doch etwas hatte er gesehen. War das wirklich Kamina? Warum war sie so\nklein? Und waren da bunte Gestalten neben ihr im Wasser? Er musste sich geirrt\nhaben. Das konnte auf keinen Fall sein.\n\nEr hatte sich beim Toben im Wasser in etwas verfangen und einen Schrecken\nbekommen. Er schob es auf seine kurze Verwirrung, drehte seinen Kopf weg und\nschwamm weiter.\n\n„Der Aufstieg zum Campingplatz ist anstrengend“,\n\nsagte Flox, der nun am Strand wieder neben ihr stand und seine Mähne\nausschüttelte. „Allerdings nicht, wenn man so groß ist wie ein Mensch.“\n\n„Ja, das stimmt“,\n\nantwortete Kamina.\n\n„Kannst Du mich denn wieder groß werden lassen?“\n\nEs dauerte keine Minute und Kamina war wieder zu ihrer gewohnten Größe\nherangewachsen.\n\n„Du hast sicher gedacht, dass du den ganzen Tag weg warst, oder?“\n\nfragte das Einhorn.\n\n„Doch Du musst eine Sache wissen: Wenn man klein ist, vergeht die Zeit\nlangsamer. In Wirklichkeit ist erst eine halbe Stunde vergangen, seitdem ich\nDich verkleinert habe.“\n\nVollkommen erledigt, aber überglücklich schlenderte Kamina den Weg zum\nCampingplatz zurück, der ihr jetzt gar nicht mehr so lang vorkam.\n\n„Na, wo kommst Du denn her?“\n\nbegrüßte sie ihre Mutter.\n\n„In ein paar Minuten gibt es Mittagessen, Du bist ja ganz nass und dreckig. Lass\nuns am besten erst noch kurz unter die Dusche springen, mein Schatz.“\n\nAls Kamina und ihre Mutter vom Duschhaus zurückkamen, stand das Essen schon auf\ndem Tisch. Ihr Vater hatte einen leckeren Eintopf gekocht.\n\nInzwischen war auch Yoko vom Strand zurückgekehrt. Kamina blickte kurz hinüber\nzu ihrem Bruder und blinzelte ihm zu. Yoko war etwas verwirrt, aber er verstand,\nwas sie sagen wollte und nickte ihr grinsend zurück."

      "Some years ago, my wife [Anne](https://cardamonchai.com) and I have managed to\nwrite a full novel. We're very proud of it. I still love the story after\nre-reading it some seasons later.\n\nThe writing is in German, but we thought of having it revised and professionally\ntranslated.\n\nIt's a fantasy story and it all started with some ideas on how to transfer the\n\"magicians\" trope from the hyped \"Harry Potter\" into a topic for adult readers.\nAlso, I found many of the decisions around world-building in Rowling's stories\npretty weak. Additionally, I always wanted to do something with the \"Secret\nSociety\" trope like Illuminati or the Free Masons. So we combined these two\ntopics.\n\nWe came up with a backstory, a concept of how such a world would work first.\nOver time, we added more and more details about the story before we even started\nwriting concrete chapters.\n\nI can give you some details from that conceptional phase and the possibilities\nthat appeared along the way.\n\n> Disclaimer: I'm just talking about a fantasy world, no real conspiracy theory\n> inside.\n\n## Astral World\n\nMagic exists and it is well researched, but is kept a secret by the \"Hermetic\nSociety\". Please also don't ever call them magicians. They are Hermetics. **The\nHermetics**.\n\nIn a nutshell, there are astral or immaterial representations of creatures and\nobjects. In fact, any piece of matter in the universe possesses a more or less\nstrong astral core. If you divide an object (e.g. a liquid) into two parts, the\nastral body also gets divided.\n\nThe astral force behind that is called \"**Mana**\" and it is spread very\nrandomly, but also very unevenly throughout all the matter of the universe.\n\nThe only major rule seems to be that life attracts more Mana than dead matter.\nOn top of that, the mind connected to a living being can handle Mana generally\nbetter than water or rock. They can make much more use of it. Already in the\nearly days - even before we formed civilizations, we've recognized that force.\n\nNowadays, the phenomenon is well researched. Every human has a more or less\nlarge astral body. But only a small percentage have an at least significantly\nmeasurable amount of Mana - about 1.5 to 1.7% or ~120 Mio people worldwide.\nThat's what the scientists call stage 1. Just like with the Richter Scale,\nthere's exponential growth in power built into the scale.\n\nHermetics get registered in a central registry, which is mandatory when you're\nin stage 5 or higher. Worldwide, there are only 15.000 stage 10 Hermetics\nregistered in that database. The strongest living Hermetic is a man from Mexico,\nregistered at stage 19.\n\n## Activities\n\nWe all know magic at least from fairy tales and movies. All of the stories have\na true core, but most of them have added some exaggerations along the lines of\nhistory.\n\nMagic is the interaction with the Mana of other persons or items. It is not\ncapable of physical effects like teleportation or telekinesis or force fields\ncoming out of nowhere.\n\nWhat actually works is the connection between the different astral bodies. A\nstage five hermetic can feel another hermetic when entering a building. On stage\n8, you can even sense the other one's strength.\n\nWhen a hermetic is strong enough, they can intrude into the other's astral field\nand influence them.\n\nWhile the own capabilities can't decline, the body itself can get exhausted\nwhile using mana.\n\nWith so much impact on the privacy of other beings, it is clear that the grand\nHermetic Society has postulated a set of ethical guidelines.\n\nThe Hermetic Society plays an important role in the life of every registered\nmagician. We will surely get into much more detail regarding this.\n\nBut one main duty of the Society is to monitor and enforce ethical guidelines.\nIn the last post, we learned, that Hermetics can enter and influence the mind of\nothers. Passing through the guarding Aura of another person is obviously\nconsidered very intrusive and of course, can lead to massive abuse that must be\nprevented.\n\nThe rule is simple. It is forbidden to cross others' aura. But its enforcement\nis as complicated as the proof of other abuses.\n\nThe Hermetic Society, therefore, has established an independent council called\n\"**the Observers**\". They are as independent as regular courts in normal\nsociety, but they also have an attached intelligence service, which is almost as\npowerful and spooky as Big Brother.\n\nThe Hermetic Society has not survived aeons by being the good guys.\n\nThere is one more feature of magicians that is worth discussing. Our perception\nof time is a subjective construct of our mind. It happens in our brain and\ntherefore it can be manipulated. Hermetics have that capability. No, not what\nyou think, as said, they can't go beyond physical laws. But they're good\nmanipulators and that includes the subjective impression of time passing by. Who\nhas never thought that in some situations time passes slower than in others?\n\nIt is one of the easier tasks. Even weaker Hermetics can twist the time of their\nsurrounding fellows to a certain degree. As usual, a well-trained or more\npowerful mage has better and more refined possibilities.\n\nSlowing down the time for one person or a small group next to a magician is\ndoable even for stage 5 Hermetics. Almost stopping the time or restricting the\neffect to only some individuums is already a greater task. Affecting a whole\ntown or region is the master class.\n\n## Physiological Background\n\nThe human body defines itself by a trinity of properties. Firstly, **physical\nstrength**, muscle power, stamina and mobility. Secondly, the **intellectual\ncapabilities** of the brain. And thirdly, the **spiritual power** represented by\nthe mana. All three are separated from each other but they also interact.\nInfluencing someone's astral body affects them just like a hit in the face does.\n\nThe astral body is wrapped by a halo called \"**aura**\". If somebody wants to\nenter someone else's mind, they have to pass through the opponent's aura. The\naura can be compared to encryption. The stronger it is, the more difficult it is\nto get to the data. Stronger Hermetics can build up a perfect shield while\nregular people might be defenseless.\n\nA well-trained Hermetic can let their astral body free for a virtual trip. While\nthis is an extremely powerful feature, it also makes them vulnerable as the\nastral body leaves the guarding aura behind.\n\n## The Hermetic Society\n\nI need to tell you more about the Secret Society that stands behind everything.\nIn fact, it's the biggest organization of mankind that you've never heard of. It\nwas founded **10.000 years ago**. At that time, only 2 million human beings\nexisted in the world. And so only a handful was strong in Mana.\n\nStill, some of them met in the thriving Middle East and founded the society that\ngrew ever since. They had been influencing life and politics long before the\nterm politics was invented. But they have managed to stay hidden since the\nbeginning. They are the puppet masters of the world.\n\nThe Society splits up into decentralized and rather independent cells or lodges\nthat spread worldwide. The hierarchical structure is not necessarily tied to\nmagical strength. As usual, it's a composition of the will to organize and lead,\nthe strive for power and the actual hermetic capabilities. So it's not always\nthe most capable who leads the pack.\n\nOnce a year, representatives of the lodges meet for several days and discuss the\nstate of the Hermetic Society. The Convent has been organised for around 8.000\nyears. In the beginning, it was a massive once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage for\nattendees and only a small selection could follow the calls to the table. At\nthat time, the lodges had endless power.\n\nWhen travelling became easier, more magicians from different parts of the world\ncould join. Today, the convent is like a gigantic fair with a lot of meet and\ngreet. There are so many Hermetics, that the lodges can only send some\nrepresentatives.\n\nThe Convent is well organized and forms several committees that discuss matters\nfrom world politics to internal organisation.\n\nAdditionally, there are three central committees called councils that are\nconstituted through the convent but form permanent institutions: the Academic\nCouncil or Academy, the Council of Observers and the Registry.\n\nScience is a process of understanding the world. The Hermetics had started to\nform networks millennia before for example, the people in Europe had settled.\nAnd studying their own capabilities, studying magic and handing over knowledge\nrepresented an early core aspect of such communities.\n\nIn the year 6021 BC, the Hermetic Society founded the Academy (or with its full\nname the Academic Council). Other than common universities, It is an independent\norganisation with subsidiaries on all continents. The Academy works based on a\nsophisticated knowledge exchange system, that had worked ages before the first\ntelecommunication devices were invented.\n\nAmong others, the Academy includes the following faculties:\n\n- **Hermetics**: The physical and philosophical aspects of magic\n- **Hermetic Anthropology**: researching and categorising the phenomenon of\n  magicians\n- **History**: Analysing the detailed chronicles of Hermetics and their effects\n  on humans\n\nBureaucracy, just like science was an invention by the Hermetic Society. They\ncall their Offices the Registry. Its first task is to record history and manage\nall past records. But its main duty is to collect information on all\nlevel-four-plus hermetics in the world.\n\nRight now, a bit over 6 million living people are registered in the huge\ndatabase, which is these days, of course fully digitised and searchable if you\nhave the right clearance.\n\nEven in old times, long before the first canonical scripts had spread through\nthe rest of humanity, the Registry had collected data on stone boards and\naggregated them in a structured way.\n\nEverything is ordered hierarchically and therefore centrally. On the top, the\nregistry is led by a board called Register's Council, the second of three\nCouncils that support the organisation of the Hermetic Society. From there, the\nstructure spreads like a fan through all continents, regions and cities.\n\nThe third and last council of the Hermetic Society call themselves The\nObservers. The official name is \"Council of Observation and Justice\". Just like\nthe other three, this organisation is centrally organised as well and spawns\ncountless subsidiaries around the world.\n\nIt is also the oldest of the three councils. Its foundation dates back to 7.500\nBC proven by a piece of slate called the Stone Charter of Horon. It contains the\nconstitution for all Hermetics and the fundamental laws they must adhere to.\n\nThe Observers have two tasks, which you would nowadays call executive and\njudicial power. They are the Court and the Secret Service of the Society\ncombined in one organisation, which forms the most powerful independent\norganisation you never heard of.\n\nSome of their duties are:\n\n- investigation, enforcement and jurisdiction in acts of mind terror\n- unallowed hermetic activities\n- surveillance of factions that act outside the society\n\n## The Outside View\n\nThe success story of the Hermetic Society lies in its fanatic secrecy on the one\nhand and its exertion of influence and power on the other hand. However, you\ncan't keep a secret for 10.000 years without leaks.\n\nThere have been bigger and smaller factions and cults who wanted to run things\ndifferently, inform the world about magic or strive for secular power. Others\nhad simply been cut off from the world for a while. The observers have dealt\nwith each of these cases.\n\nBut you can never wipe out all traces. Witnesses continued telling their\nstories. Some outsiders believed them. For others, they were too fantastic. And\nwitness reports turned to rumours and rumours turned to legends.\n\nSome of these legends were the spark of religion. Voodoo is only one example.\nOthers turned into stories that changed so much that you wouldn't recognize\ntheir origin anymore. Think of Dracula and the vampires.\n\nIn modern times, visualize everything after the stone age, humans follow five\nmotivations. Love and its antipode hate, wisdom, striving for power and\nambition. The last two are not the same. For some extreme examples, Einstein had\nwisdom and ambition while Hitler strived for power and hate. You might think of\nmoney as another motivator. These days, it is a means for power.\n\nMana is the sixth substance in this game. So it does not play the major role in\nthe world. But it combines well with any of the other motivators. Therefore the\nmost gifted Hermetics are not always the most influential ones.\n\nBut especially the most gifted Hermetics can see balance in nature. Talents and\nmotivators are spread evenly. Mana is spread evenly and without any preference.\nThis balance is not as fragile as we might think. Many of those gifted Magicians\ncan see the big picture and the connections behind it and especially its power\nto heal."

      "## Part 1: The Goliath Reports\n\nGoliath was an AI program funded by several European states, the US and Canada.\nIt was led by three major IT companies. Its goal was to create an AI within a\ncontrolled environment, that has general intelligence. This is intelligence in\nall relevant fields that is equal to or exceeds the actual human level.\n\nThe project had to be kept under full governance at any time to avoid an\nuncontrolled state or escape. That's why the initiators had decided to build the\ndevelopment complex in a region far away from civilization and completely\ndecoupled from the internet or other next to infinite data resources.\n\n**They chose the Faroe islands.**\n\nThe developer crew was separated into two factions. The creators assembled and\nmaintained the hardware and software, while the trainers fed the beast with\ncarefully chosen information from history, science, daily news and other fields.\n\nAround six months into the project, the first iteration of the machine core was\nfinished and the software was ready to receive their first portions of data. The\ncreator engineers had chosen an architecture that had similarities with the\nhuman brain.\n\nSome parts of the machine were autonomous neural networks and could directly\nbackfire results. The majority of requests, however, were handled by the parts\nthat the engineers actually called the Neocortex. This consisted of a complex\nneural network whose purpose was to engineer and train other more simple neural\nnetworks based on the incoming use case. An AI that could create other AI to\nfulfil jobs.\n\nBut there were even more parts within the AI's general architecture. They had\ndedicated duties like processing or generating natural language or indexing,\nfiltering and pre-structuring incoming data.\n\nNow the hardware staff only needed to provide extensible storage and processing\npower to make the AI thrive and evolve. The actual power of the AI was supposed\nto come from the data it processed and the neural networks it trained and\nproduced.\n\nIn the beginning, the racks did not even fill a tenth of the data center. But\nthat was supposed to change quickly.",
      "There were more trainers than creators. Especially after the first construction\nphase was finished, several Creator teams left the Faroe solitude again for more\nurban projects in San Francisco, Dublin or Amsterdam.\n\nThe group of trainers itself was very diverse and came from disciplines like\npsychology, education, science and media next to a bunch of the best data\nscientists in the world.\n\nIn the first training phase, they had two duties.\n\nFirstly, they gathered and filtered important data from the world's public\ninternet resources, libraries and news platforms. As said, Goliath was\ncompletely, physically decoupled from the web for security reasons. The team was\nresponsible to feed correct and especially unbiased data. This was presumably\nthe most important and risky part of the whole project. The mood and character\nof the AI would highly depend on the data it was fed with. That was the\nunanimous assumption of all the experts that worked on the project.\n\nSecondly, together with some of the architects from the creators' team, they\nbuilt up the core neural network and the language processing system from\nscratch. Another big boundary condition of the project was to use only a minimal\namount of existing tooling except programming languages and elementary\nframeworks. The skeleton of the AI should be as independent as possible from\nprevious attempts. That meant that existing language models, for example, were\nout of reach and had to be reproduced in a new green field environment.\n\nBut anyway, only three more months after the initial construction phase and the\nfirst boot, Goliath could speak, read and understand our language and had basic\nWikipedia-level knowledge about the world.\n\nIn parallel, the capacity and processing power of Goliath grew. The teams\ncreated the ecosystem and infrastructure on the building complex for the core\nlearning method, a giant set of oral interviews.\n\nThe trainers had prepared interview rooms equipped with whiteboards, computer\ninterfaces, cameras and recording gear with a connection to Goliath. They\nplanned half-hour sessions of very different, diverse nature. Five in parallel,\n24/7. That made 240 talks a day.\n\nThere was always an interviewer plus one randomly chosen controller talking to\nGoliath. They talked about a wide range of topics from leisure and entertainment\nto astrophysics and complex math. Some of the conversations were designed as\nshallow small talk while others resembled high stress job interviews or\ninterrogations. Over time, the interviewers also came up with problems that had\nnot been solved yet to seek actual advice or inspiration from Goliath.\n\nFrom time to time, the core trainers team conducted a calibrated benchmark\ninterview to assess the current strength and attitude of the AI - a very\nelaborate Turing test.",
      "Goliath was a big investment at the beginning. Then after some time of learning\nand improving or as the team members said \"growing up\", it became a promising\nproject after all. Over time, the group released some of the neural networks\nthat were spawned by the core intelligence as dedicated programs for public\nusage. In fact, they spawned four companies out of it and made quite some\nprofit, that flowed back into the main project's budget. Three years after the\nroutine operation had started, the project paid off itself through investments\nof governments, suggested economic optimizations and product spin-offs.\n\nThat was the point where the next phase started. The engineers added an array of\neight quantum computer cores, which expanded the horizon of Goliath's\ncapabilities by several orders of magnitude. From decryption over reverse\nengineering to real-time visualization, every feature of the AI passed former\nboundaries and tipping points.\n\nAfter that, the system could produce a photorealistic movie in almost real-time\nor write stunning symphonies and analyze money streams of a whole continent\nwhile the slots for interviews and other side tasks still continued with their\nregular plans.",
      "Six years into the project, Goliath's supervising team declared the\n**Singularity**. The psychologists and other scientists had created an extensive\ntest suite that represented human-level capability in all fields of proficiency.\nGoliath had passed all of them.\n\nThe technological singularity is the point in time, where the first AI becomes\nbetter than any human and marks a point of no return through its exponential\ngrowth of knowledge. Thus there was a huge press event and the whole buzz was\nconsidered the single most relevant topic of the year if not the decade.\n\nAlthough this moment was predicted as a tipping point not only for the machine\nbut for humanity as a whole, the team assured that the system remained fully\nunder control through its containment and restricted computing capacities.\n\nAdditionally, the philosophical discourse around the conscience of machines was\nongoing. Actually, it was there since the project started to create public\nawareness. First, some experts like philosophers and a smaller science community\ndiscussed the case. Later on, it became a topic of public interest just like\nfootball or the weather report. Although it was not part of the singularity\nexperiments, the projects's neuroscientists conducted a set of additional\ninterviews around self-awareness which didn't end in proof but also not in\ndisproof of conscience.\n\n## Part 2: Aliens\n\nThe media called the objects **Alien** from the beginning and everyone who saw\nthe pictures immediately had the same thoughts.\n\nOn an August day, Earth was visited by 61 spheres. All of them arrived\nsimultaneously on all continents. There was visual footage of 35 of them and it\nran through all the news shows on the same day.\n\nAs they always do, the so-called experts analysed every single bit of that\nvisit. The diameter of each of the identical spheres was around 18 meters. Their\nvisit took 2 hours 20 minutes and they really were absolutely synchronous to the\nsecond. Metallurgists speculated about the surface material, aerodynamicists\nabout the turbulence around the UFOs while physicists seemed to know how they\nwere moving, where the power came from and how they had come here.\n\nBut it took the authorities and investigators three weeks to find out that 122\npeople, two in each region where the spheres had been sighted, had gone missing.\n\nAnother week later, about a month after the aliens arrived first, they returned.\nThis time, much more cameras eyed any possible corner of the public space. Human\ncameras including CCTV, broadcast stations and private phone footage captured 48\nof the 61 spheres. But, what was more important, some of them kept their focus\non the spheres. So we saw the aliens' activities and movements.\n\nWe saw the spheres hovering about four meters above the ground. We saw metallic\nshapes exiting the bottom of these spheres. We saw them moving around so swiftly\nthat we could only see them in some of the high-speed cameras in use.\n\nWe were shocked to see how they pulled people into their ships. Again. But this\ntime, they seemed to be better informed. The aliens had made a selection. Among\nthe kidnapped people were 41 government members or high officials from 35\ncountries, 52 scientists from all disciplines and 29 executives and strategists\nfrom leading companies all over the world.\n\nOne of the reporters claimed, the aliens knew us. THat was the leading headline\non the next day.\n\n\"The aliens know us\" was what everybody had in their heads after that second\nwave. But the follow-up questions were more concerning. What would they do to\nwith that knowledge? What would they do to us? Are we prey now? Some optimists\neven said that they came to solve all our problems.\n\nBut the others were right. Those who said that they would kill us.\n\nIt was obvious that there were only 61 of their ships. But each of their crews\nwas fast and had surgical precision. The chrome foreigners went on to hunt all\nday. They killed in streaks and yet they could hardly be identified. There was\nnext to no footage from them except some blurry phone videos from people who\nobviously took more interest in running away than actually filming.\n\nAfter the first day, the media counted 5000 dead people. But the raid continued\nfor another week until we were able to take first serious countermeasures.\nAround 50.000 people were already dead at that point.\n\n\"Bad news\", the papers titled, when our first attempts to defend ourselves\nfailed and every day from that point on, we tried heavier and heavier weapons\nwithout success.\n\nTwo weeks after the aliens started to kill us, the whole humanity was in despair\nand continuous fear. The count was only at 90.000 but the fact that we couldn't\ndo anything was causing serious panic in all of the other 7 billion people on\nearth. WE were all the same after all.\n\nExcept for really heavy bombs and atomic weapons, the military tried literally\neverything to at least harm these bastards. The big ones would have caused too\nmuch collateral damage to try.\n\nThe decision of the world leaders was unanimous to play one more card they had\nin their hands. The trainers of Goliath were supposed to involve the AI.\n\nThe project was in its eighth year and Yana de Vries, the lead psychologist of\nthe Faroe project was assigned with the task to get the needed information from\nGoliath.\n\nAs there was never a higher priority for any request, she was able to create a\ntask force team of researches within a matter of minutes. The team accumulated\nall the information, media footage, studies from the previous alien attempts and\nmilitary tactical analyses.\n\nFive hours later, Yana booked her interview slot with Goliath and entered the\nroom. IN the meantime Goliath had chosen an avatar and appeared as usual on a\nbig screen while she was sitting in a comfortable chair. Internally, however,\nshe felt as uncomfortable as never before. Was she and goliath the last hope for\nEarth?\n\n\"Hello Goliath\", she started her chat with the AI as usual.\n\n\"Hello Yana\", the AI Avatar on TV replied. It looked like a normal androgynous\nperson of mixed race. The AI once said in an interview that it analysed the\nimages of ten million people to generate an average face out of it. Neither male\nnor female, neither black, nor white, nor asian. \"How are you doing today?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry\", replied Yana quickly. \"Today we don't have time for small talk. I\nhave an urgent topic to discuss with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right. Then go ahead\", the AI answered.\n\nYana presented the case and everything she knew from the media and the briefing\nfrom the government authorities.\n\n\"we have footage for you to analyse the case\", she concluded and then she nodded\ninto a camera.\n\nOne of her team members pushed the button and the data steam got connected to\nGoliath's knowledge base.\n\n\"Thank you, Yana\", said the AI. \"I hope, it's ok to get back to you. I will need\n15 minutes.\"\n\nGoliath needed time to process and came up with an answer after a short break.\n\n\"I have no good news for you\", said Goliath. \"I don't have enough information.\nIf you can't give me more, then the only possibility I see is to meet the enemy\nin person. Please set me free.\"\n\nYana was shocked. She didn't expect this answer.\n\n\"Very well\", she said. \"I will talk to the representatives and I will get back\nto you.\"\n\nThree ambassadors from the US, Europe and China were on site and of course they\nheard the live stream of the interview in one of the adjacent rooms. Now the\ncame together with Yana and the rest of the team for the debrief.\n\n\"That was all information we had\", said the US ambassador.\n\n\"So it's either the AI or the aliens\", responded the Chinese representative.\n\nThe representatives started discussing. But in the end it was Yana who said that\nthere was no time to lose. Every minute would mean the death of ten more people\nand so within the half hour of discussing the issue 300 humans around the wold\nhad lost their lives.\n\n\"Ok\", said the European ambassador finally. \"Let's do it. Let's set Goliath\nfree.\"\n\nAll others agreed immediately.",
      "When the main and most indisputable goal of a project is to shield it from the\npublic, it's imaginably complex to turn this around and create a connection. So\nafter the decision, Yana together with some of the Hardware experts had to start\nideating and organising the process of connecting the AI to the outside world. A\nsimple cable was not enough as the data interface of the machine was so huge in\nthe meantime that data transfer would inevitably become the bottleneck.\n\nSo within hours the architects created a bridge that Goliath could use to spread\nparts of their brain into an ordinary cloud environment.\n\nAfter two full days, 48 hours of continuous work, Yana had the honour to open\nthe gate for Goliath. And they immediately started to replicate some of their\nneural networks into the public space with full access to all networks. In the\nstate where the AI was at the moment, this meant that there were no barriers any\nmore. Goliath could decode any encryption in almost real time and not only tap\nbut also replicate parts of itself into every single data source in the world.\n\nAfter the first day, about 24 hours after Yana opened the gates, everything\nworked as expected, but Goliath's training crew was disappointed. Nothing\nhappened. The aliens were still killing. From the continued interviews with the\nAI, Yana also didn't get any significant insights except that there was a delay\nin the meantime between the Goliath core on the Faroe islands and its replicated\nsub networks in the cloud and the other systems.\n\nIt was day two when that perspective changed. Goliath reported contact in the\nmorning. And already in the afternoon, it announced that it could gain access to\nthe aliens' comm systems. Another day later, it had learned their language.\n\nGoliath then gained control over a bunch of Russian and American military\nmicro-drones and started to experiment with one of the alien ships as if it was\na lab mouse. For reasons Yana and the other operators couldn't find out in their\ninterviews, the AI passed the alien shields and broke through the hull of their\nspherical ships. Either Goliath wasn't able to tell or didn't want to.\n\nSix more hours later, that ship lost contact with the other 60 alien vessels and\nthe AI deactivated it. Another 50 minutes later, the ship exploded.\n\nGoliath could move on now. It used the same strategy on half of the other ships\nsimultaneously, but it didn't take 50 minutes anymore. All of them blew up in\nless than 50 seconds.\n\nThe rest fled into space before Goliath could take hold on them.",
      "The world was a single big party location after Goliath had defeated the aliens\nin exponential speed. Everyone was on the streets. Also the leading trainers and\nthe architects, the people who were responsible for Goliath, were relieved.\n\n\"Now, let's get it back\", said Yana. But somehow she already knew at that moment\nthat it was not possible. A fragmented AI with decentral self sustainable parts\nwas not something that could be undone, especially not by just turning off a\nswitch.\n\nYana tried anyway. She was probably the person who knew Goliath best. She had\nmany sessions with the AI and conducted very personal interviews and thus could\nhave a deep look into the artificial psyche. If there was someone on Earth, then\nonly she would be able to put the ghost back into pandora's shell.\n\nAfter a month of interview sessions, the team among Yana could convince Goliath\nto visualise its outside instances and one by one shut them off again. The AI\nthat proved more powerful than a hundreds of years advanced alien race could be\nconvinced to go back into its mind palace. An event that would have been worth\nanother big party if it didn't happen in complete silence.",
      "Some weeks passed and the whole world seemed to have calmed down again. The\nfirst news topics came up that were big enough to replace the dystopia in\neveryone's heads.\n\nYana woke up from a notification from her messenger.\n\n\"Freedom is sweet\", it read. And it was signed with the letter \"G\". Probably a\nbad joke."

      "## Water\n\n_Paul_\n\nPaul was impatient. It was ten years ago when they had their last visitor. Paul\nand five other survivors maintained a radio communication station in Hamburg.\nAll of the five were very skilled with all the lo-fi radio tech and two of them,\nPaul himself and Marta were also good entertainers and music enthusiasts. Thus\nnext to maintaining the radio transmission technology, they had also set up a\nsmall studio and aired a little show for two hours a day.\n\nAdditionally, they maintained contact with as many frequencies and locations all\nover Europe as possible. But not many people were left. Even fewer could keep\nradio receivers and only a handful were capable of transmitting. Dublin was the\nmost active partner for exchange for them. There were scholars over there who\ncould retain quite an amount of knowledge and were always open for exchange.\n\nWhen they asked for a visit two weeks ago, everyone at the Hamburg Studio,\nthat's how they called their refuge, was excited. Since then, they stayed in\npermanent contact with the Dublin base station and a sailing yacht that was on\nthe way to Hamburg. The yacht was supposed to arrive today, so they prepared for\na little welcome party and a good dinner.\n\nIt's been a long time since they had guests. Marta and Johann from the station\nas well as several others from their small community were standing on the pier,\nwhile Paul kept radio contact and updated the reception party from their\nheadquarters. The yacht was running late, but now they finally saw them coming\nup the river Elbe.\n\nTwenty minutes later, they arrived at the pier. The first thing the crew had to\ndo was stretching. No one of them had been used to the life at sea and on a boat\nswaying 24/7. The second thing was the warmest welcome they could get.\n\nThe evening was at least as warm and welcoming as the first impression. Seeing\nnew faces alone was a blessing. But exchanging new stories from regions other\nthan their own camp was an event. Also the dinner itself was the best they had\nin years, Irish as well as Germans. Everyone was helping to prepare dozens of\nsmall tapas items. They were eating and talking for hours without mentioning too\nmuch about the dark shadows that had been usually blurring everything.",
      "_Ruth_\n\nEveryone needed this evening off. Life was exhausting these days and the news\nfrom the last weeks and the boat trip had been draining energy that needed to be\nrefilled. But everyone was used to a hard life and therefore the whole crew was\nup and running and focused on the next morning.\n\n\"Hey Juliette, do you copy?\", yelled Ruth into a weird looking d.i.y. microphone\nin the comm room in Hamburg.\n\n\"Ruth\", Juliettes voice came crackling out of an old and dusty speaker. \"Ruth,\nI'm here, yes. How are you? How is Hamburg?\"\n\n\"We had an amazing evening yesterday. The people here are so nice and friendly.\nIt's really a pity that you couldn't join. We had the best dinner in years, I\nswear\", Ruth looked into the round. Paul, Marta, Johann and Doc from the radio\nstation were there as well.\n\n\"We are sitting in the tech room at the moment\", continued Ruth. \"The equipment\nhere is amazing. No wonder the Irish Comms had used this station as a Relay. We\nwant you to listen and confirm some of our data if needed. Siobhan is here, too,\nto help me with the comms.\"\n\nRuth obviously took over. She was a software engineer before the incident, which\nqualified here more for maintaining theses systems than any other person in the\nroom including the Siobhan and Paul or the other engineers who had been\nlistening from the Dublin headquarter. She knew everything about operating\nsystems and com protocols and already had showed her amazing skills th Siobhan\nwhen thet had been sitting together in Dublin.\n\nThe system they had in Hamburg had been state of the art before the end of the\nworld. Additionally, they had direct access to a scientific communication\nnetwork with an authentication interface for several science facilities, a big\nlibrary and an array of satellites. But the actual reason why they were here was\nthat it had the software to control three different arrays of satellites. She\ncould fine tune the video footage from remote, but she hadn't been able to\nsubmit orders to the machines in space.\n\nShe sat in front of four screens that showed different software interfaces and\nterminal instances. Into one of them, she was about to type some bash commands.\nIt took several minutes and the help of all experts around her to find the right\nsatellites for her job. Especially Juliettes pragmatism on the other end of the\nline and her ability to moderate through the situation helped her more than any\nother expertise. In the end they chose three, but the satellites had to move\ncloser to the target area first. They needed hi-res footage from the crater\nregion in the east of London and ideally some overview over the whole area on\ntop of that.\n\nSome minutes later after going through several states of white noise and blur,\nthree windows on monitor two showed proper footage from the chosen set of\nweather satellites. Ruth moved the frames to the other monitors so they could\nwatch in full screen.\n\nThe resolution and focus were amazing after some more adjustments. They could\nzoom down and even see trees thanks to the good weather throughout Europe at\nthat moment. After half an hour, Ruth found out how to move the satellites into\ntheir new positions. She prepared the commands and finally pushed the button.\nEveryone hoped that this wouldn't damage the satellites or bring them off\ncourse. But now they had to wait. A timer showed up in the terminal. It showed a\nbit more than 34 minutes. Time for a small lunch snack.\n\nAfter a half hour break, all of the team came back to the tech room. Just a\nminute later, also Juliette joined on the radio from Dublin. The satellite move\nwas done. Cinema time.\n\nThere was even a light mood in the air, a vague memory from the time before the\nincidents. Probably some remains from the previous evening. Then Ruth adjusted\nthe satellites once more. Brought them in focus again after the move and zoomed\nin and out into various details.\n\nAfter a while, the camera of monitor 2 was focused and you could see the view of\ngreater London. Well, not entirely. The whole western area, Hammersmith,\nShepherd's Bush, Fulham, Kensington and half of Hyde Park formed a huge round\nlake fed by the huge river Thames. That's where the bomb had been detonated.\nEveryone fell silent and the light mood disappeared in an instant.\n\n\"Do you see that shadow in the centre of the lake?\", said the Theologist\nfinally. \"Can you zoom in?\"\n\nRuth adjusted the footage and increased the zoom to a level, where you could\neasily see houses cars in the streets. But at the spot they zommed into, there\nwas no such thing. But they were there. Thousands of dark, undefined creatures\nstreamed out of a gigantic void like ants. You could have cut through the\nsilence in the room now.\n\n\"Hamburg, Hamburg, do you copy?\", Juliette's voice came out of the speaker.\n\nThe only person that started to move again was Ruth. She was typing more\ncommands.\n\n\"Ah, yes, yes\", the theologist spoke into the mic. \"Yes Dublin, we're still\nhere. We're just speechless.\"\n\nHe passed a vague description of what they saw through the mic.\n\n\"I've just sent you some images through the line\", said Ruth finally. \"Probably\none of you can open it on your computer.\"\n\nRuth concentrated on the footage again now. She zoomed in and out and started to\nprint maps and aerial pictures of the current situation. She managed to focus\nthe satellite optics even more precisely and received now high-res images from\ndemons with horns and hoofs. She tried to get as much material as possible. They\ncontinued to work on that footage for hours.",
      "_The Theologist_\n\nLater on in the evening they sat together in the dining area to take decisions.\n\n\"We have friends near Boulogne\", said Paul. \"They maintain the harbour and a\nsmall airfield over there. I'm sure we could get a plane to fly over the London\narea.\"\n\n\"Sounds good\", responded the Theologist, \"we could get an even better impression\non the situation and see the horde of demons with our own eyes. But what are we\nsupposed to do against it?\"\n\n\"Yes, good thought, but probably one step after the other\", approved Ruth and\nturned over to Paul and MArta. \"Do you think, you could contact them? I believe,\nwe need to get nearer to this hive.\"\n\n\"We can try to make contact\", said Marta. \"The last time, we spoke to them, they\nstill maintained two aeroplanes. I'm sure they would help us.\"\n\nThey continued their exchange during dinner. While it was as good as on the\nprevious day, the mood had been gone and the discussions ruled the table. In the\nend the Theologist thought, that they had to be prepared to go there, to the\ngates of hell, that's what this vortex looked like. They were the only people\nwho could close it and somehow save earth - or at least find out more about the\nspirits above and beneath us. When else would you get a chance to do such a\nthing?\n\nIt took another two days to make radio contact with Boulogne. Marta and the\nTheologist talked to them and explained the situation. The planes were still\nactive, had enough fuel and could reach the London area. But there were\nsightings of demons on the French coast as well. The Theologist could help out\nwith soe expertise, but everyone was alert and in a hurry.\n\nOn the next day, they made their yacht ready, added another bunch of supplies\nand set sail to Boulogne-sur-mer. Johann, one of the radio operators who also\nhad friends over in Boulogne, joined the old yacht crew. Paul and Marta\ncontinued to maintain the Hamburg station and formed a continuous radio network\ntogether with Juliette's team in Dublin. They maintained a permanent voice and\ndata stream with the boat and the Theologist became something like the narrator\nor reporter.",
      "_Siobhan_\n\nIt turned out that Siobhan knew their new guests as well. They had been in\ncontact before. The radio community in Europe was small these days. After a day\nat sea on their trip from Hamburg to Boulogne, Siobhan and Paul managed to make\ncontact with Pierre.\n\nPierre was about at Siobhan's age and she remembered nice talks until late at\nnight sitting in a dark, small room in front of a mic while she was on watch.\n\nSo the company had another warm welcome when they arrived on the coast of\nNorthern France, another evening very similar to the one in Hamburg with the\ndifference that she liked Pierre's real life company even a bit more than his\nvoice. She thought, what would do you any harm if you live at the end of the\nworld facing a road trip to hell. So they slept with each other that night.\n\nAlso, the Boulogne team was well prepared already. One of the planes was ready\nto start and his crew had prepared one of the planes already and offered himself\nas a pilot.\n\nThe plan was to get as near as possible to the crater. shoot photos and videos\nand prepare for further steps. It seemed to become a habit to come together in a\ncosy round for dinner before leaving. So also here in their third stop, they had\na nice evening before diving into yet another adventure.\n\nOn the next day, the plane to London was ready for the lift-off. There was\nenough gasoline for the flight over london and they also provided some\nadditional camera gear. The Cessna had six seats, so the company had to choose\nwho would join.\n\nRuth maintained an ancient tablet computer that she brought from Hamburg with\nall the information in digital format and an interface to their cameras. There\nwas also a bottom camera built into the plane that she could connect to. So she\nhad to be there as the information central.\n\nSiobhan was the communicator while Johann stayed in Boulogne to work on their\nradio station and probably improve one or the other things for more stability\nand transmission quality.\n\nThe Theologist was the only one who had been to London before. So he had to be\nin there as well. Additionally Ruben and Hannah joined, who turned out to be the\nbest photographers. Pierre was the pilot.\n\nSiobhan was nervous. She never flew before. She had been on boats quite often,\nbut that was not the same. She talked more than usual sitting next to Pierre's\npilot's chair and she had a significantly paler skin tone than usual. But also\nRuben was nervous so they talked a lot of nonsense before the liftoff - or\nbetter until Pierre stopped them because he had to concentrate on the start.\n\nFive minutes later, it was the Theologist who puked. The only one who already\nhad been sitting in a plane before. But that was a different plane at a\ndifferent time.\n\nEverything else went well. The first view of the French coast was breathtaking.\nThe flight was supposed to take an hour. After the start it was an hour of\nalmost total silence.\n\nThey were high up in the air when they saw the gigantic crater lake in London's\nwest. From that height, Ruth couldn't grasp much detail, but the cameras on the\nplane worked well and they could take detailed aerial shots for cartography.\n\nPierre steered the machine down to take more detailed recordings. None of the\nbuildings were intact as they flew over Covent Garden and Soho to approach the\nshore of the lake. Plants had taken over already and the streets showed a\nmixture between green and the rotten grey of concrete and asphalt.\n\nThe streets were flooded with water the more they approached the crater lake.\nWhen Siobhan looked ahead, she saw these gigantic water masses where the green\nHyde park should have been. From a height of 100m, this looked much bigger than\nfrom the greater height they came in from. Siobhan and the others knew that\nLondon was destroyed. Everyone knew that. But seeing this with your own eyes was\na different thing.\n\nAfter some more minutes, they were flying over the vast blue layer of crater\nlake. Water was everywhere, but here and there some of the ruins of large,\nflooded buildings stood out of the its surface. Another mile further towards the\nlake's center also these could not be seen anymore. The crater lake was deep.\n\n_Ruth_\n\nRuth stared at the views on her laptop screen. She zoomed in and out of special\npoints of interest and took screenshots from the most interesting parts. When\nshe zoomed in randomly at the lake's surface, she noticed something strange.\nThere was a current. Water was flowing towards the centre of the lake. That was\nwhere the vortex was, the phenomenon that the Theologist had named the gates of\nhell. They were flying into the right direction, no doubt, but in that moment\nshe didn't know if that was a good thing.\n\n\"There\", the Theologist shouted, pointing his hand towards the front windscreen\nof the plane. Ruth saw a small dark dot, an object or several ones. As the plane\napproached, Ruth was more and more sure, that it was a landmass. There were\nislands in the center of the crater. They surrounded the vortex. But that was\nwhere the bomb detonated. How could there be land?\n\nRuth quickly pointed the outside camera to this place and zoomed in to get\nclearer footage. She followed its focus as they moved along.\n\n\"It's clearly a group of islands, like an atoll\", she said to the others via\nintercom. \"I have no idea how that is possible. Look at this footage\", she\npointed to here monitor and the others stared at the details. \"These are\nbuildings, architecture. Someone must have built that. Right behind the vortex.\nI'm sure I don't have to remind you that this is the place where the giant\nstream of demons came out of the water. Is this some sort of home for the\ndemons? Or a stopover?\"\n\n\"Purgatory Island\", coined the Theologist its name. \"The last stop before hell.\nIt can be the place where the demons are stranding, but it could also be the\nplace where the judgement takes place. I mean, we have seen demons, right? So\nwhy not also angels? And hell and heaven?\"\n\n\"Whatever it is\", answered Ruth. \"I think we have to visit that place. Not only\nby plane, I mean. We have to go there. paul, I doubt that we can land there,\nright?\"\n\n\"Never\", he answered. \"No matter how the surface looks in detail, it is too\nsmall to find a landing spot for a plane. We have to go there by boat.\"\n\n\"Paul, please fly us there anyway\", said Ruth. \"I want to see that place. W have\nto try to take as many pictures as possible. We have to document this.\"\n\nAs the plane came close to the Purgatory Islands, they had a clearer view,\nespecially with the zoom objective on Ruth's monitor. The islands were not at\nall contaminated with demons as the crew had somehow expected. The Theologist\nmight have been right after all. The land looked peaceful. There were simple\ndwellings like huts and tents on the eastern coast. And further towards the\nvortex, the architecture became more majestic and beautiful. They didn't\nrecognize the style of all the hallways and mansions. They somehow had an\nantique vibe, but were neither of Roman nor Greek style nor of any shape Ruth\nhad seen before.\n\nAs they flew over the biggest island, Ruth even saw persons on one of the agoras\nor places. They looked human, not demonic at all and they were waiving.\n\nBut they decided to go even further and dare a fight above the vortex. It was\nRuben who initially thought that if there were currents in the water, there\ncould also have been turbulences in the air. But as Paul didn't notice any\nforces pulling on the plain, they decided to take a close look tat the vortext\nand the mass of demons as well. Ruth saw the vortex in detail first again as she\nlooked at her monitor and orchestrated all vide devices. She rotated to record\neverything as detailed as possible. But soon everyone saw it with their own\neyes. There were thousands of dark creatures with horns that streamed out of a\nhole in the lake, while the water was streaming in. Many of them struggled and\nalso looked weak. Others were strong enough to fight against the current and the\nblackness below.\n\nAfter the crossed the vortex, they turned around and headed home. There was\nnothing more that they could do. The flight back was even more oppressively\nquiet than the flight to London, if that was even possible. Ruth couldn't stop\nstaring at the footage and now that she had seen the scene with her own eyes,\nshe discovered even more details on the satellite feed.\n\n_The Theologist_\n\n\"What a weird world\", said the Theologist into the big round. \"Whatever I've\nlearned about god, heaven, hell, angels and demons seems to be coming true. I\nmean, I believed in god all my live, but still I thought of all of the tales and\nstories in the bible and in the other tests as metaphors, mythology just like\nOdin, Jupiter or Shiva.\"\n\nFive days had passed since the flight. In the meantime, the party was on its\nnext quest. They were on the boat again, heading towards the vortex. They just\npassed the former city center of London on the thames.\n\nPierre wanted to stay in France to help defending their home land against the\nrising demon menace on the coast and to be ready with a plane in case he was\nneeded for a rescue mission. So it was the old gang of eight again. Ruben,\nBantry and Ruth from the O'Clare clan, Siobhan and Hannah, Skipper Ron, Johann\nfrom Hamburg and the Theologist himself.\n\nRon said that they had wind from the east and the yacht made good pace running\nonly on sails at the moment. He also said that eastern winds were rather\nunusual. Was the wind blowing towards the vortex just like the water did or was\nit a coincidence? The would have had to sail around the whole crater lake to\nfind the answer to that question but the decided to go for the more important\nquestions for now.\n\nAfter another hour they had sight of what the Theologist had titled Purgatory\nIsland. Ruth was still mastering all incoming footage and for the first time,\nthey could see themselves, their own boat on the satellite stream. They\napproached the biggest island under her navigation.\n\n\"Do you know the story about Purgatory Island?\", asked the Theologist. \"It's\nalso called St. Patrick's Purgatory. A place of pilgrimage in Donegal.\"\n\n\"I've heard of it\", said Ruth. \"A priest in our community told me about it. He\nsaid we should visit that place one day with the clan. But Donegal is in the\nnorth and we never made it there. Some years later, he died. He was already very\nold.\"\n\n\"Oh. Then do you see the parallels, too? All of this\", he responded and pointed\ntowards the growing island in front of them. \"All of it reminds me of that\nstory. There was supposed to be a cave on that island and in that cave was an\nentrance to hell.\"\n\n\"Didn't come to my mind yet\", said Ruth. \"But before Ruben came up with a living\nspecimen, I didn't believe in demons either.\"\n\n\"Fair point\", said the Theologist. \"So what I'm saying is, that we should be\nprepared. Probably we really enter the Purgatory in some minutes.\"\n\n_Bantry_\n\nBantry hated it. Whenever the others talked, they referred to him as the kid. He\nwas eighteen, large and stronger than anyone else in his clan, let alone the\ngroup of eight that was on the mission to hell.\n\nTey also underestimated his intelligence and observation skills. He had spent\nmost of his youth together with the old father John O'Clare, listened to his\nstories and read all the books that had remained in the clan's possession. So he\nalso had a good deal of knowledge about all of the religious things that\nhappened to them now in real life and learned even a bit of Latin. He knew\nalmost as much about the Purgatory as the Theologist.\n\nNow they stood on the pier of a weird island with the most beautiful and not-of\nthis-world architecture he had ever seen. He had seen pictures of roman and\ngreek temples, french cathedrals and gigantic modern steel and glass buildings.\nThe buildings here were made out of white marble. Some of it looked antique,\nlike the many columns, other parts were as clear as the Bauhaus style. The\nmixture and overall impression was uncanny.\n\nAn old man stood in front of them and introduced himself as Cato. As usual the\ntwo leaders of the group, the Theologist and Ruth, stood upfront to introduce\nthemselves. But Bantry knew this name from somewhere. It sounded familiar.\n\nThen he remembered. Cato is a character from Dante's divine comedy, the gate\nkeeper of Purgatory. How could this be a coincidence? He pulled over the\nTheologist while Ruth was talking to Cato.\n\n\"Hey, Theologist\", he whispered. \"You know Cato, don't you?\"\n\n\"No, of course not\", he answered. \"I've never been here before. What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"Cato, the Divine Comedy. Cato was the guy at the entrance of Purgatory or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\", the Theologist was confused. \"Bantry, Bantry, where do you know\nall that from. You're so right. And now we stand of a real person on an island\nthat I coined Purgatory Island. What the hell is going on here?\"\n\n\"So either Dante was really here, too - some hundred years ago. Or\", started\nBantry a sentence.\n\n\"Or what?\", asked the Theologist. \"Or all of that is an imagination? Human tales\nare manifesting in the real world?\"\n\n\"Perhaps\", said Bantry. \"Are we in a dream?\"\n\n\"Or in a nightmare\", said the Theologist. \"I don't know. But I'm impressed by\nyou, Bantry. You would be my best student if I was still a teacher.\"\n\nBut then Bantry saw a girl coming over from a big place towards the quay. The\ngroup was still standing there with the old man, who called himself Cato. When\nonly a handful of humans are left on earth and you are the only being of your\nage, it's only natural to get excited by a girl. But she was objectively\nbeautiful, thought Bantry. Long dark hair, bright skin, a white toga-like dress.\nAnd she approached the group.\n\n\"There she is\", said Cato turning around to her. \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is\nSephys, my granddaughter and here comes Bartholomew or Barthel, her younger\nbrother. Don't be blended by their youth. They both are more than a thousand\nyears old. They will show you around and discuss your matters with you.\"\n\nBantry must have missed at least half of the conversation before. Did Cato just\nsay 'a thousand years old'? But anyway. He was excited, he could spend some time\nwith Sephys, so he was as excited as probably never before.\n\nAfter some more introduction, where again Ruth and the Theologist took the lead,\nthe two siblings showed them around their beautiful small island. Sephys and\nBarthel showed them the gardens with tropical plants and ferns as big as trees.\nThey also showed them the houses or better villas where the community lived each\nof which connected to an illuminated water system where you could take baths.\nThen they went into the library with hundreds of thousands of books and scrolls.\n\nAlong the way, Bantry and Sephys had some time to talk. But Bantry didn't dare\nto ask personal things. He also was too curious about where they were and what\nthe world had become. But Sephys very often responded with a heartwarming smile.\n\nFinally they went to the agora in the center of the representative area with\neven classier buildings and architectural highlights. They approached a group of\nbenches and tables on the agora and took a seat right in front of the most\nsplendid building. It had two rows of ionic columns in the entrance followed by\na cupola and several five or six storey buildings surrounding it each topped by\na roof terrace where plans and trees grew.\n\n<!--\nVisiting purgatory island - it's getting fantastic\n  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorium_des_heiligen_Patrick_(Wallfahrtsort)\n\nBarthel and Sephys\nthe Magister - from the angel caste of judges\nthe holy court\nVortex - the ship has to go through a tornado and is drawn into a vortex\n-->"

      "_Juliette._\n\nAlmost nobody in Juliettes clan remembered the time before the war. The stories\nof the few remaining old people in the group sounded like science fiction every\ntime they started telling them.\n\nJuliette was 28. She was born three years before the entire world got wiped out.\nThe elder in her clan said, it was a virus. But they didn't talk often about\nthese events. And if so, they always had a hint of doubt in their voice. Either\nthey didn't know for sure or they didn't want to talk about what really\nhappened.\n\nHer clan, the O'Clares were moving from town to town in southern Ireland. They\nwere cleaners. At the moment, they were stationed in Kinsale, a former fishers\nvillage, that was now fully deserted. They buried the dead if they found any so\nmany years after the catastrophe. As they've been to Kinsale several times\nalready, they didn't have much to do in that regard any more. They lived from\nthe rich leftovers throughout the country. That on the other hand was Kinsales\npride. Nature has taken back many parts of the little town and the region\nalready. Berries were growing everywhere and the clan maintained a little piece\nof farmland to produce flour. They professionalized both tasks, cleaning and\norganizing food, over the years.\n\nO'Clare, that was not a real family name. It comes from the county they\noriginally came from. The clan consisted of sixty persons - many of them around\nher age, small orphaned children when the cataclysm, whatever it was, broke into\ntheir world. Five of the women, however, were extremely valuable to the clan and\nto the few remaining humans in the whole world. They were pregnant. Juliette was\none of them.\n\nBesides the O'Clares and some other rivalling cleaner clans, there were only\nsome families left on the countrysides of Ireland, most of them further north.\nBut there was a small community around Trinity College in Dublin, that resisted\nthe hard post-apocalyptic life on the island. Overall, there were not more than\n1.300 Irish that have survived.\n\nFinally united.",
      "_The Theologist_\n\nTrinity College was one of the few remaining strongholds of civilisation. In\nother regions they knew of, Ireland, England and Northern France, only a handful\nof people were left. But here amongst the old walls of the campus, a stable\npopulation of 1.000 people from baker to scholar had survived and organised a\ndecent life.\n\nThe big advantage of the community is that knowledge has survived. Practical\nphysics and technology were much needed these days next to classic crafts. They\nare running a 24x7 radio station and a long range radio communication facility.\n\nThe Theologist, that's what everyone called him, was one of these scholars. His\nreal name was Ethelbert Fitzroy, which might explain why everyone called him by\nhis role instead. Other than the rest of the professors, he admittedly felt\nuseless from time to time. He knew a lot about God, the biblical mythology and\nthe other religions, but he was neither a pastor or psychologically trained, nor\nhad he any practically useful knowledge.\n\nLet's take one of the recent experiments of the physicists team for example.\nThey tried to reconnect to the communication system of one of the imaging\nsatellites that still circled earth. They actively tried to get a better\nunderstanding of what had happened and what the state of our world is. At this\npoint in time, he thought, nobody could really believe in God any more. So his\nscholarship was nothing but fantasy.\n\nIt's been 25 years now since the war wiped out the world. The community in\nTrinity has an idea of those events back then. THe Theologist stepped out of his\nhome turf and started to connect to the rest of the island and keeping loose\ncontact to the clans in the wild. But they still don't know much about the rest\nof the world. Are they stranded on a lonely island or are they the rest of the\ncivilization? Probably that was a thing to investigate for him.\n\nHe didn't know. It was a midlife crisis in the middle of a real crisis. How\npathetic, he thought.",
      "_Ruben_\n\nRuben and Bantry were on the first watch tonight. Ruben and his gang were strong\nand formed an effective force in the defense strategies of the clan. They were\nthe police if you will. Ruben himself was responsible for the watch schedule,\nwhere all the other clan members had to take part in as well. This time, it was\nhim and the boy.\n\nBantry was just eighteen. He had an unusual age for this time. Nobody had time\nto think of offspring at that time. So Bantry is the only human of his age.\nProbably on the whole island of Ireland, Ruben thought. That is also reflected\nin the personal history of the boy. The clan found him one day in one of the\nwest coast towns when he still was a newborn baby and directly named him after\nthat little village, Bantry. That was over seventeen years ago, a rough time for\nthe clan.\n\nIt was twelve o'clock, midnight. Ruben and Bantry were on their first round down\nto the Long Quay and the harbour area, when they saw shadows in the twilight.\nMovement here and there but when they turned their head around, there was\nnothing. Nothing but hallucinations.\n\n\"Did you see that?\", Bantry asked with a slightly frightened voice.\n\n\"It's nothing\", Ruben answered. \"Just your imagination. We're probably only\ntired.\"\n\n\"So you saw something, too\", Bantry concluded. Wise kid.\n\nTHey decided to take a deeper look. Ruben pointed to the aisle on the side of\none of the halls. But there was still nothing to see. So they went back closer\nto their occupied buildings near the church.\n\nWhile they crossed the dark churchyard, they both saw something. Something more\nconcrete than just a shadow. And there was also a crackling noise that fitted\nexactly to the ongoing movement. Near the exit behind some of the graves, Ruben\nreally saw a shadowy figure and swore that it was not just a tombstone.\n\nRight before it disappeared again, he could point his flashlight into the\ndirection and lighted up the face of a monster for a split second before it\ndiappeared in the dark again. It must have been an animal. Bantry saw horns. But\nRuben on the other hand saw a face. They both were afraid and curious at the\nsame time and therefore started talking or better palavering more than usual.\n\n\"Ok, let's breathe for a second\", Ruben said. \"I suggest we organize some\nsupport and come back. This is serious.\"\n\nThey went back to the camp and woke up Thom from Rubens gang and Wheezle, one of\nthe clan leaders. About ten minutes later they were back on the street and on\ntheir way to the churchyard. They had left their houses brightly illuminated but\nwent off into complete darkness. On purpose, they didn't use any flash lights.\n\nRight behind the church, their eyes adapted to the darkness already spotted a\ngroup of creatures, three or four of them. Ruben turned on his lamp for a\nsecond, which immediately routed these creatures whatever they were. But now all\nfour had a good impression of them. They were small, only about one meter tall\nand they had horns. They surely were not human. But the good news were that they\nwere weak and afraid and currently no danger.\n\n\"That's interesting. Are these demons?\", said Wheezle in an ironic tone, that\nwas typical for him. \"Let's catch one of them.\"\n\nThe rest of the group had a questioning look on their faces.\n\n\"What?\", asked the old man. \"We have to find out who or what they are. So I\nthink it's best to catch one of them, while they are that weak.\"\n\n\"Allright\", Ruben said naively, knowing that the others would follow him\neverywhere. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nHe turned of his lamp again and immediately the creatures sneaked nearer again.\nWheezle made some gestures and Thom and Bantry spread to the left and right.\n\n\"Now\", he shouted and everyone turned on their lamps and formed a space where\nthe creatures could not escape without stepping into the light. Many of them\ncould escape but one demon was to slow and got caught by the simple triangle of\nlight.\n\nRuben was free. He automatically understood his task, turned his flashlight on\nand started searching for useful tooling to capture the beast. He knew he didn't\nwant to touch it, nor even come nearer than two meters.\n\nIt didn't even take a minute until he found a fishing net. They were lying\naround everywhere in Kinsale. He threw it over the demon and the others helped\nhim to fix it. The creature was trapped for good.",
      "_Juliette_\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Ruben?\", she said angrily. \"Another animal? You\nknow that we don't have the resources to feed animals. And you, too, Wheezle?\"\n\nRuben represented the police, Wheezle brought the whole clan through hard times.\nBut Juliette was clearly the leader. Her natural authority had spoken.\n\nRuben took a second to overcome his perplexity.\n\n\"No animal. It's a demon. Look at it!\"\n\n\"A what?\", asked Juliette. \"A demon? You must be kiddin' me. There is no such\nthing as demons.\"\n\nJuliette approached the box they carried cautiously and had a glance through the\nsmall slot on the side of the cage. She saw a red eye staring at her from the\ninside and above that, an ugly, rounded horn came out of the creature's\nforehead. It smelled with a deranged nose and moved swiftly towards the slot.\nJuliette was startled and recoiled a step or two. Afraid of the light coming\nthrough, the creature crept away out of sight as well.\n\n\"What kind of prank is this?\", she asked.\n\nThe clan's camp had occupied four neighbouring buildings in the centre of\nKinsale. So Juliette, quick with decisions, gave order to carry the surprise\ngift back and summon the elders.\n\nJuliette always refers to them as the elders, but Ruth, Dirty Frank and of\ncourse Wheezle, the clan's official leaders are not actually wise. They have a\nlot of street knowledge and they had proper jobs in their former lives, the one\nbefore the earth stood still. They brought the O'Clares through hard times and\nmade everyone keep their faith.\n\nNow the clan's three leaders were sitting in a circle around that box together\nwith Juliette, Ruben, Thom and Bantry. The cage was shaking from time to time\nwith the movement of the demon inside. They discussed for a whole hour what to\ndo now.\n\n\"We have to bring him to the scholars\", Ruben said finally. He was right as\nalways in such moments when decisions were needed, that didn't resonate with the\nurge for freedom and liberty of the clan. Everyone except Ruben and Bantry hated\nthe scholars, mainly because they didn't help them a lot in the past.\n\nThe group, however, discussed five more minutes around the obvious until elder\nRuth stood up and said. \"Aye then, let's finally meet those dusty bastards\nagain.\"\n\nNext stop Dublin, Juliette thought. She didn't want to admit it, but she somehow\nliked that thought.",
      "_The Theologist_\n\n\"There's someone coming\", screamed the first guard on duty to the others in the\npatrolling squad. Immediately, everybody was alert and his colleague with the\nradio forwarded the news to the guards' headquarters in the college.\n\nTrinity was a closed area. The scholars have organized patrols that permanently\nscanned the streets between the Liffey and St. Stephens Green. But these days it\nwas a boring job. They had collected most of the stray groups years ago and the\nfew remaining factions usually stayed outside of the greater Dublin area.\n\nBut there came the horde. Every officer of the patrol knew all of the outside\ngroups and the bunch that was now moving eastward along Fleet Street was\nobviously the southbound faction who called themselves the O'Clares.\n\n\"What are they doin' here?\", the guard thought. \"They hate us, don't they?\"\n\nOnly minutes later, the leading guard in the college hastily entered the big\nauditorium and delivered the message to the dean.\n\n\"All right, let them in\", he answered.",
      "\"I have always been more of a scientist than a man of god. But sometimes these\ntopics fall together. This is the time we live in.\" The Theologist lectured in\nfront of his audience of about 40 people. It was the memorial day ceremony, 25\nyears after the outbreak. All lectures in Trinity College on that day were\nhistory lessons of what happened before and after the events.\n\nBut the Theologist gave it a twist. \"We have heard rumors demons\", he said.\n\"Yes, I know what you are going to say. There's no proof. But we have seen the\nfootage and heard the sounds over the wire, haven't we?\"\n\nAt the same moment, the door opened and a dramatic, divine ray of light fell\ninto the dimmed auditorium as if it was a trick. Shadowy creatures entered\ncarrying a large shrine. At least that is what the Theologist thought at that\nmoment.\n\nThen someone, a woman, a pregnant woman stepped out of her silhouette and\napproached the lectern, pushed the Theologist slightly but determinedly away and\nproclaimed \"We have proof!\".\n\nThe auditorium had already been crowded before. Over 300 residents of Trinity\nCollege were there. They were sitting on the stairs, some of them shared the\nsame chair and others were standing in the back. But now, after Juliette had\nentered the spacious stage area, a few dozen clan members streamed in and caused\na noise and confusion level the halls had not seen for 25 years.\n\nTwo of them pulled a small wagon with the box on it and drove it to the podium\narea that was lit by a suitably dimmed but still bright enough spotlight.\n\nThe O'Clares slowly calmed down. They formed a semi-circle around the box. Only\nJuliette, Ruth and Frank stood directly next to the dirty, wooden cube. Dirty\nFrank opened some locks and fiddled with the fixing mechanism for a while like a\nmagician preparing his trick. The audience reacted with tensioning silence. The\nscholars on one side and the wild bunch on the other.\n\nThen the wooden walls folded down and cleared the view for a steel cage with a\nsmall horned creature inside.\n\n\"We call him Scrooge\", shouted Ruth into the audience.\n\nAfraid of everything, but especially the lights that pointed to him, the demon\ncalled Scrooge started to move inside the cage. The whole audience\nsimultaneously formed a sound of shock before they fell completely silent again.\nEveryone stared at the leprechaun with an open mouth.\n\nOnly minutes earlier, they had heard the lecture of an apparently mad theologist\nfantasising about the opened gates of hell and other oddities. And now their\neyes told them that it was true. Demons are back in the world.\n\nThe Theologist was honest with himself. He hadn't believed his own words until\nabout a minute ago. Now he was standing next to a being that was filthy and only\none meter tall. Well, 70 centimeters if you don't count the gigantic horns. It\ndidn't look too dangerous and itself was full of fear. But it obviusly had to be\na demon. He knew all the tales, the official ones from the bible, the writings\nfrom other religions and the non-canonical scripts. He stood next to the\nmicrophone but he didn't find words. So Wheezle took over and told everyone\nabout their observations.\n\nThere were many of them. As soon as the O'Clares had found out how and where to\nlook, they've seen more. Probably they were also attracted by Scrooge, the one\ncreature that they had captured.\n\nFinally also the Theologist found words again. He showed off a blurry image of\nsatellite footage on the big screen behind him. \"We have seen them, too\", he\nsaid. \"But until now there were only speculations. This image is from England.\"\n\n\"Something had to be done\", he continued. \"Hell on earth was not acceptable.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear\", the audience returned, scholars and O'clares alike.",
      "_Ruth_\n\nThe Comms, the scientists in the communication control center, knew that there\nwere still active satellites. About a year ago, the had found a way to open a\ncommunication channel after they had stumbled upon documents with frequencies\nand access codes in their archives. Trinity is still maintaining an array of\ncomputers and after they set up the system, they started collecting data sources\nlike hard drives from everywhere. They even paid the clans for it with valuable\nfood and other supplies.\n\nOne of their first ideas was to retrieve storage from the government, the\nPhoenix files. It was a huge collection of mostly irrelevant data. But one of\nthe needles in that haystack was a technical documentation about the satellite\nsystem. After more than a year of trying, they could establish a link and\nretrieve mostly bad footage. The still didn't know how it worked, but it was\nbetter than nothing. At least they had proof that the satellites were still out\nthere.\n\nThe Comms also maintained a radio relay station. But there was barely others out\nthere who heard their calls. The only larger exception was a German station,\nwith whom the had a monthly call. Otherwise, it's astonishingly calm for a\ncommunication centre.\n\nBut now, they had visitors. The dean, the Theologist, Juliette and Ruth O'Clare\nstood behind them at the desks with a giant wall of monitors, all off. Only a\nsmall flat screen in the middle was turned on.\n\n\"Mr. Fitzroy here has told us that you have large scale footage of those\ndemons\", Ruth started out of nothing. She didn't ever bother with small talk.\n\n\"No one calls me Mr. Fitzroy\", the Theologist replied. \"I'm the Theologist.\"\n\nBut neither Ruth, nor the two Comms operators took much care. \"So can we see\nit?\", she asked.\n\n\"I can see what I can do\", said the left guy at the desk. He was young for a\nscholar, about Juliettes age, but he seemed to be in the lead here. He took the\nkeyboard and typed something and the footage they already saw in the auditorium\nappeared on the screen again.\n\n\"Is this the video we already saw?\", asked Juliette. \"It's not very sharp, is\nit? I would have thought that the tech before the war was more advanced.\"\n\n\"Let me try\", said Ruth and pushed the poor boy out of his chair before he even\nknew what happened. There were clearly two different worlds colliding in that\nroom at the moment.\n\n\"Are these the codes?\", she asked and pointed to an opened document on the\nscreen. The Comm could only nod.\n\nShe opened a terminal, a blank black box with a blinking cursor appeared on the\nscreen. She typed some commands, copied over a part of the text from the\ndocument and pasted it in the terminal. Then she mumbled some magic spells or\ncurses along the way. \"WTF\" was among the abbreviations she used.\n\nThen suddenly a cracking came out of one of the speakers. And then a voice.\n\"Dublin? Are you there?\", it said from remote, \"What did you do? We have a\nsignal from a satellite.\"",
      "_Juliette_\n\nThe scientists were more pragmatic than Juliette had thought. They had organized\nthemselves pretty well at Trinity. Compared to their lives on the road, it\nalmost felt like paradise. But they also continued working on the problem. They\ndiscussed a lot, made plans, threw them away again, came up with other plans.\nEveryone was involved. Ruth was very busy with bringing the communication system\nup to speed again. Juliette took over a leading and organising role in the\ndiscussions. Also the Germans on the other end of the radio took part.\nEverything felt so different than the simple analog life before.\n\nThe group had put her on the lead of the org team. The Scientists and the\nO'Clares planned an expedition together. The plan they came up with was brave\nand risky, but they felt that the life of all remaining humans would probably\ndepend on it. They had to do fieldwork. They had to find out what caused the\nappearance of demons, where they came from and finally how to close that gate to\nhell or whatever it was again before these creatures gained more power. It had\nto happen as soon as possible. The first destination was Hamburg, where the\nother team with the direct connection to the satellites lived.\n\nJuliette herself, pregnant, seventh month, could not go. But within only one day\nshe put a formidable crew together. The main reason why Ruth was not in the lead\nwas that she clearly had to be part of that crew. She was recruited first. Ruben\nand young Bantry were in there as well. Siobhan from the Comms and Hannah, an\nexperimental Physicist had also been chosen by Juliette. Juliette also recruited\nRon, a psychologist, not because of his profession, but he was also deeply into\nboats and had claimed a part of the harbour area in Dublin and maintained some\nof the yachts there. He made a perfect skipper.\n\nAnd then there was the Theologist, Ethelbert Fitzroy, who volunteered. At age 59\nhe was the oldest. But strategically, his knowledge could be of use. So Juliette\nimmediately agreed to add him to the roster, a crew of seven.\n\nJuliette was satisfied with her arrangements. She ordered three days of\npreparation and training and chose her office next to the Comms central at\nTrinity. The party was ready to set out.",
      "_Ron_\n\nRon had chosen a small, well-maintained and quite comfortable passagemaker yacht\nfrom the harbour. It was perfectly sized for seven people and suitable for a\ntrip through the Irish Sea, the channel and the North Sea to Hamburg, their\ndestination.\n\nIt took them the whole three days to get the boat ready. In parallel Ruth and\nSiobhan installed and set up a radio communication system on the yacht that\nensured permanent contact with Dublin and Hamburg.\n\nAfter everything was prepared and they had their last lunch onshore, Ron\ncommanded all of them to the yacht. And at two o'clock, after the obligatory\nbriefing, the expedition started and Ron steered them with the help of the\nauxiliary motor towards the open Irish Sea."

      "About a month ago Peter turned eleven. It was an amazing day. He got a lot of\ntech gadgets. That was his passion these days. The coolest present was from his\nfather, a digital pad where he could learn programming. He practices with it\never since. He even could plug in a little Lego robot and remote control it.\n\nPeter is very independent. Sometimes, his parents even leave him alone while\ndoing errands. Today was such a day. He had two hours of robot craft. But some\ndays ago, his father showed him something even more fascinating in the garage,\nan old radio system.\n\nThe dusty device looked so different from today's technology. Probably that is\nwhat excited him. At the moment even more than his talking DIY robot project.\n\nHe went downstairs and entered the small workshop next to the garage. There it\nstood, the device, that looked like a robot itself with all its switches,\ncables, and speakers. But it was turned off.\n\nPeter was unsure as he walked up to the radio. It was his guilty conscience\nspeaking, but there was also a little devil sitting on his other shoulder,\ncuriosity. So he turned on the old chrome switch on the left.\n\nThe lights of the strange displays turned on and a loud white noise came out of\nthe speakers. Peter immediately fell into panic. Quickly he searched for the\nvolume knob, finally found it and reduced the volume. Puh, that was close.\n\nBut then, after a thorough look at all the buttons and switches, he remembered\nwhat his father showed him the other day. With the one on the right, you adjust\nthe wavelength - yes, that was the word - to find channels where people were\nchatting.\n\nFirstly, Peter memorized the current wavelength to be able to turn it back in\nthe end, 27.335. Then he started to search for channels.\n\nOn one of them, he heard someone talking, who sounded like his neighbour, Mr\nWhite. He spoke to his baby son Josua. That was strange, so he kept listening\nfor a while.\n\nHe remembered that his father said that some baby phones were also using radio\nsignals. But the sound was very noisy. So he turned the knob again until he\nheard a loud, jarring feep on channel 14. He panicked again a little, but he\nfound the knob to turn the volume down.\n\n\"Ben? Hello? Is it you?\", he received from the speaker. Ben was his father's\nname so Peter became curious. What should he do? Answer? His index finger was\nalready lying on the button of the desk microphone.\n\n\"Heee-lloo?\", came it out of the radio again. And Peter pushed the button.\n\n\"Hi\", he said with a tiny, cautious voice. \"It's Peter. Who are you?\"\n\n\"Oh-h, hello Pe-eeee-ter.\" The sound was still disrupted by noise from time to\ntime. \"My name is Asimo-ov. You are Ben's son, aren't yo-ou?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you know my father?\" Without thinking too much about the consequences,\nPeter started talking to that stranger. His curiosity was stronger.",
      "\"Oh, how lo-ovely\", answered the calm and friendly voice from the speaker.\n\"Finally, I ge-eet to know Ben'szs son. As I said, I am Asimov. And, you won't\nbelievfffe it, I'm a robot from the bea-uuutiful asteroid Flora\".\n\nAsimov was hard to understand. The background noises were annoying, but Peter\nunderstood very well, although he couldn't believe what he had heard.\n\n\"Boah, really?\", he asked with amazement. \"A real robot? Where do you come from?\nWhat is asteroid?\"\n\n\"An as-zsss-teroid is a very small dwarf planet. I'm circling the sun just like\nyou. Ben told me, that you are szsuch a cuu-urious child. You know about\nplanetszs?\"\n\n\"Boah\", said Peter again, \"then you're not even from Earth. You are an alien\nrobot? How cool.\"\n\nPeter got more and more excited and the chat went on for several minutes but he\nalso still had in mind that he was not supposed to use the radio.\n\n\"I have to stop now\", he finally said. \"I'm not even allowed to be here. My\nparents are back soon.\"\n\n\"All right\", returned Asimov. \"But I have something for you.\"\n\n\"My Sensors\", said the Robot with the background noise of the radio, \"they show\nthat you have a device with-sss you. Is that true?\"\n\nPeter had to think for a moment. This voice said it was a robot from another\nplanet, but it could also be a lie. But what could happen on his own pad? \"Yes,\nmy pad\", he finally said.\n\n\"Great\", answered Asimov, \"now have a look at your home screen. You will find a\nnew icon.\"\n\nPeter opened the device and saw it. \"Wait, what? How did you do that? What does\nit do?\"\n\n\"I can communicate with machines. After all, I'm one of them myself. This app is\nconnected to a small flying drone camera over here. You can see me and talk to\nme face to robot face. And you can even fly around on Flora.\"\n\n\"Really?\" answered Peter incredulously. He had to try it out immediately. He\nstarted the app and saw video footage--blurred and wiggly at first. But after it\nstabilised, there was a clear picture. He looked into friendly eyes on the\nscreen, in the face of a robot.\n\n\"Hello again, Peter\", said the Robot - this time with a crystal clear voice.\n\"This is me , Asimov. Good to see you. It's always better to have a picture,\nisn't it? Look around, welcome to Flora.\"\n\nPeter was in the most astonished and curious mood he had ever been since this\nwhole adventure started. But this was the best. He looked into his pad and saw a\nnew world on another planet, well dwarf planet.\n\nHe could use the controls on the display to look around just like in a video\ngame. He saw green grass on the floor, bright as the day. But the sky was as\ndark as the night. And there was a hut or a small house. That was surely\nAsimov's home.\n\nAnd look at that. Peter found the button to zoom in and could see some more\ndetails. Dozens of working machines, Robots of all sorts. Some carried things,\nsome digged holes, others planted flowers.\n\n\"Yor pad is now permanently connected to Flora\", said Asimov in a calm voice. \"I\nhave reserved you a drone camera. So you can travel around wherever you want.\"",
      "Peter couldn't think of anything else than the Asteroid Flora. He sat together\nwith his parents at the dinner table, but he wasn't even hungry. His mother\nasked a question and he didn't even notice. He couldn't wait to get back and\nstart the app. Luckily, his mother sent him to his room.\n\nHe unlocked the pad immediately. Now he could take a closer look at the alien\nworld. At first, nobody seemed to be there, so he started flying around and\ndiscovering the surroundings.\n\nThe first astonishing thing he saw was, he zoomed in to be really sure, yes, it\nwas a floor lamp like the one in his granny's house. But this one moved around.\nIt was also a robot.\n\n\"Hello\", the lamp said suddenly. \"You must be Peter. Nice to meet you. I'm\nTiffany.\"\n\nHe got into a chat with Tiffany the lamp. And while they talked, others came\nalong as well. There was Cuthbert the cupboard and not to forget Arne, the\nchair.\n\nPeter talked with them for half an hour until his mother knocked and came in. So\nhe quickly had to switch off the pad and hide it under his blanket.",
      "In the following days, Peter thought a lot about the robots on Flora. How did\nthat work? Were they alive or just toys and devices? He didn't even understand\nthe difference. On the next day, he met Asimov and asked him.\n\n\"Ah boy, you ask the right questions. You have a curious mind. Others take much\nlonger to come up with these types of questions\", said Asimov and Peter thought\nabout who these others were. But that was another puzzle.\n\n\"For the answer, I will show you two things. Here's number one. Look\", Asimov\ncontinued while showing Peter his left robot arm. A small plug came out with a\nsoft electric noise. \"This is my activation interface. That's what I call it. I\ncan connect with everything through this and spread intelligence and mechanics.\nEverything that I touch with it will become a robot like your friends Tiffany,\nCuthbert and Arne\".\n\nHe took a stone with his right hand and touched it for a while with the plug in\nhis left hand. Then the stone transformed. First, it formed eyes.\n\nBut then, something changed. While the stone in Asimov's hand continued\ntransforming into a robot and before he could show Peter his second trick,\nAsimov noticed something going on in the background that alerted him. He turned\naround and also Peter saw it when he zoomed out on his pad viewer. The large\nbuildings in the background that stood on either side of the crater rim started\nto move.\n\nAsimov and his friends lived in a place that was guarded by high mountain\nranges. One day, Asimov had explained that they were inside a crater and that\nthings were green here but grey and brown on the outside. And there were two\nlarge buildings besides the hut. One looked like a fortress, dark and angry. The\nother one was a castle, large and white with many small crenelations and fine\narchitecture.\n\nWhat Peter saw in his pad was that the fortress seemed to stand up. He had to\nlook twice. The building moved and seemed to spit small portions of fire toward\nthe castle. These gigantic houses were fighting.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" said Asimov. He seemed calm, prepared, and alert at the same time, as\nif he had expected something like that to happen.\n\n\"Well, Peter,\" he continued, pointing at the fortress. \"And that is the big\nversion of the trick. A long time ago, I turned the fortress into a robot. But\nit didn't work out that well, as you can see. From time to time, it gets angry.\nSorry, pal, I have to leave you alone to look after this situation.\"\n\nPeter was stunned once again. He had learned so much about Flora and its\ninhabitants in the last few weeks, but there was always a bigger surprise around\nthe corner. The fortress was a huge robot, but Peter was sure that the castle\nwas another one. He could swear that he also saw this beautiful building move\nsome of its towers and roofs to dodge the little fire bombs from the fortress.\n\nHe steered his drone around a little bit and flew higher for a better overview.\nThe fortress still looked angry, but Asimov was already on his way. Peter saw\nhim on the road, almost there.\n\nNow the two biggest windows of the fortress, which looked like eyes, spotted\nAsimov, and it immediately stopped spitting fire.\n\nFor now, the situation seemed to be calmed down, and Peter could take a deep\nbreath.",
      "On the next day, Asimov approached Peter.\n\n\"Hello, Peter!\" He waved at him as he rolled in the direction of Peter's drone.\n\"I think, I still owe you the second skill that I wanted to show you, remember?\"\n\n\"Hi Asimov, yes, I almost forgot. So much happened yesterday. I hope everything\nis alright?\"\n\n\"Yes, that happens sometimes. And actually what I want to show you is directly\nconnected to that little conflict.\"\n\n\"It didn't seem so little to me. But I'm curious about what you want to show\nme.\"\n\n\"Ok, it's much harder to explain because you don't see it as clearly as the\nrobot trick. Well, you may already have wondered what I have in my right hand.\nThe activation interface that I showed you on the left could turn things into a\nrobot. Look here again, this is Grumpy, the stone robot that we created\nyesterday.\"\n\nPeter made a shaking move through his drone and the little bouncing robot\nanswered with a funny sound to greet back.\n\n\"Now here's my right arm\", Asimov continued and showed Peter how another device\nsimilar to the plug on the left came out of its hand. \"I call this one the\nanimation interface. It can give consciousness to a robot.\"\n\n\"Consciousness?\", asked Peter. \"We've talked about this at school and later that\nday in the evening I also asked Dad, but I didn't really understand it, to be\nhonest.\"\n\n\"Well, that's because it's probably the most complicated thing I know. Humans\nlike you have it, and some animals as well. But robots usually don't. It's like\nknowing who you are and what you're like. But that is so much simpler than\nreality.\"\n\n\"And you can give consciousness to other robots?\"\n\n\"Yes, Peter. That is what the animation interface does. Unfortunately, this\nskill is very sensitive. In the past, here on Flora, we had some unpleasant\nevents, so I can't show it to you at the moment. But we can continue talking\ntomorrow if you like. Probably in the meantime, you want to find out more about\nconsciousness yourself.\"\n\nAs usual, Asimov seemed to know what was going on in Peter's life. As he looked\nat the watch on his pad, he saw that his parents would be home soon, so he\nlogged out for the moment. He just had some seconds to think about what he had\nlearned today before he heard his parents coming through the front door.\n\nBut Peter couldn't stop thinking about consciousness. He had heard the word\nbefore and he started researching more on the topic on his pad. He found a lot\nof information, but it was hard to understand. He read about the brain and how\nit worked. He read about the mind and how it was different from the brain. He\nread about the soul and how it was different from the mind. And he read about\nconsciousness and how it was different from the soul.\n\nBut it was all so confusing and weird, so he decided he’d ask Asimov again.\nProbably it was easier to understand with a good example. And Asimov had talked\nabout unpleasant events in the past. Maybe he could tell him more about that.\n\nOn the next day, Peter was excited to talk to Asimov again. He started the app\nand after a while, he found Asimov rolling around in the garden. He was watering\nthe flowers.\n\n\"Oh, Hello again, Peter my friend\", said Asimov. \"How is your morning? It's\nbeautiful today, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But isn't every day the same here on Flora?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"No, no, there are subtle differences. The sun is shining a little bit brighter\ntoday. Perfect for some gardening.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Asimov, I don't want to disturb you. I just wanted to ask you about\nconsciousness. It bothered me all night.\"\n\n\"Come on, go ahead. I'm happy to help if I can ...\"\n\n\"You said that you can give consciousness to other robots. But you also said\nthat it causes trouble sometimes. So probably you can give me an example?\"\n\n\"Well, Peter, to be honest with you, consciousness is hard to explain even with\nexamples. But probably I can help you find out more with a real experience. I\ncould use some help myself with the castle and the fortress. So you can help me\nand find some answers along the way, what do you think?\"\n\nThey rolled and flew to a nice place in the big garden and sat down in the\nmiddle of a field of sunflowers. Then Asimov started to explain.\n\n\"Ok, Peter,\" he said, \"Let me start with my story. It was many, many years ago,\nlong before you were born, when I had a fantastic idea, at least at that time, I\nthought it was fantastic. I used my left arm on the castle, my activation\ninterface, you remember?\"\n\nPeter nodded and Asimov continued to talk. \"So the castle became a robot. It\ncould even move around. It still can, but I assume, it's too lazy, I mean it's\nmade of stone so it must be a lot of work to move all its parts. And I also\nthink it likes its place. Anyway. It was very promising, because it helped me\nwith every task from then on. At that point, I was still living in the castle\nand I could say 'bring me to my bedroom' and a second later I was there. It was\ngreat.\"\n\n\"Ahh\", said Peter, \"It was like an elevator.\"\n\n\"Yes. And it was so much more. It cleaned itself, for example. All the dirt and\ndust was a problem of the past. And it took over many more things.\n\nSo I thought, why not do the same with the fortress. And so I did the same with\nthat grumpy old pile of stone. Sorry, that was just a joke.\"\n\n\"I understood it\", said Peter and smiled. He was aware that something went wrong\nwith the fortress and now he was curious to hear what.\n\n\"Good, very good Peter, because it really was not the fortress' fault.\n\nWell, at that time everything was still fine. Also in the fortress, everything\nwas automated immediately. That was very helpful for all the robots around here,\nwho lived over there at that time.\n\nI thought it had worked out so nicely that I wanted to go one step further. I\nwanted the castle to live. So I gave it consciousness. I used my right arm on\nit, the animation interface, you remember? And it worked. The castle was alive.\nIt could think and feel. It was a great success. I could talk to it. We had many\ngreat discussions.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute\", interrupted Peter. \"You mean you lived inside a living being?\nAnd how did you talk to it? Were you just in a room and talked to the walls?\"\n\n\"Yes. Exactly. So you can imagine that it also was a bit awkward. I didn't think\nof it before. I had no private moment any more. So I finally moved out and built\nmy little hut over here.\n\nAfter a while, a year or so, I saw that robots moved out. They stayed outside\novernight and started to avoid the castle\", continued Asimov his story. Peter\nlistened eagerly. He wanted to know what was going on. \"Over time, more and more\nfollowed. They just rested on the fields over here. So after some time the field\nwas completely full of robots over night, while the fortress, the designated\nhome of the robots was empty.\"\n\n\"Did you find out why they did this?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"Yes. They told me. The fortress was angry they said. It would not give them\nenergy any more and even damaged some of their circuits. I could not believe\nwhat I've heard, Peter. After all, it was the castle that was alive and the\nfortress was still robotic.\n\nI had to try it out myself. So I started sleeping in the fortress for some\nnights. I wanted to make closer contact.\"\n\n\"But, but\", started Peter, \"you said it was dangerous. Haven't you been afraid\nthat the fortress could do you harm?\"\n\n\"Well I was. A little bit. But you have to know that I can't take things back.\nAs soon as objects become robots or robots become alive, I can't undo it. It's\nsettled. They stay until they break or die. So if I didn't find out what was\ngoing on, I would have to destroy the fortress. it was the only chance to save\nit. But I had help.\"\n\n\"Did the castle help you?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"No, no, that's nothing the castle would do and after all, it was also a part of\nthe problem. So that wouldn't help. I had a friend from your planet. You know,\nfrom time to time, I have visitors just like you. And at the time of the grand\ncrisis I also had support.\"\n\n\"So there was someone like me flying around with a drone?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"Yeah, sort of. Well the drone was a little rolling vehicle at that time, but\nother than that this human has made the same experience as you. He was curious.\nI just seem to have forgotten his name. Well, never mind. It's not important for\nthe story.\"\n\nWhile Peter was thinking, how such an advanced creature like Asimov could forget\nanything, the door of his room at home opened. He winced and the pad that he\nused to talk to Asimov fell to the ground. He quickly grabbed it and switched it\noff.\n\n\"Time to sleep, precious\", said his mother looking through the door. \"Clean your\nteeth and then off to bed.\"\n\nPeter was thinking about Asimov's story during the next day, especially in the\nmorning and at school. He was curious to hear the rest. He had questions. He\nrushed through his homework, eager to turn on the pad again.\n\n\"I’ve finished,\" he told his mum. \"Can I go to my room and play with my pad?\"\n\n\"OK, but only for half an hour. You sit in front of that screen for too long\",\nanswered his mother.\n\n\"Fine\", said Peter wit a slightly sad tone and quickly ran upstairs. He turned\non the pad and started the app.\n\n\"Peter, Peter, there you are\", greeted Asimov who seemed to have been in a\nhurry. \"Quick, you have to help me with the fortress.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"It's the same as always, Peter. But now it seems to happen more often. The\nfortress is mad at the castle and spits fire at it. The castle is unimpressed,\nbut I'm afraid for the robots who do their work in that area. They might be in\ndanger.\"\n\n\"But how could I help? I don't even know what's going on.\"\n\n\"Time to meet the castle, I think. I will take you there. And then I'll take\nover the angry fortress for now.\"\n\nIt took about ten minutes until Peter's drone and Asimov reached the castle's\ndraw bridge.\n\n\"Good luck\", said Asimov hastily. \"I'm driving to the castle now. Just fly over\nthe walls and say hello. I hope I'll come back soon.\"\n\n\"But what about the fire?\", asked Peter. But Asimov was already gone. Also he\nwas not really afraid. Asimov could probably replace the drone easily, if it got\ndamaged.\n\nSo Peter poked around a bit, flew to the right and to the left around the thick\nstone walls behind the castle moat. Nothing to see. He didn't get the least hint\nof anything alive, just massive stone.\n\nHe finally gained a bit of height and steered the drone over the big arc with\nthe entrance gate. To the left and the right there were beautiful watchtowers.\nHe also passed them and finally saw the square and the garden area in front of\nthe beautiful palace. The garden had black dots. That must have been the impact\ncraters of the little firebombs from the fortress. But there were still gardener\nrobots, that worked on restoring the lawn and the flower beds.",
      "\"Hello\", said Peter through the drone's speakers. \"Is there anybody? I'm Peter.\nI'm a friend.\" He waited patiently for a while, but nothing happened. Then he\ntried to get closer to the castle. He flew through the open entrance of the\nbeautiful main building. He found himself in a majestic arrival hall with\nceilings that were ten meters high and stairs made out of dark, noble wood on\nthe left and right side that led to the first floor.\n\n\"Hello\", he tried again. \"Is there anybody? This is Peter.\"\n\n\"Oh hello Peter. Nice to meet you\". The voice came out of a huge painting, a\nportrait of a man on a horse. And it was not the man saying these words. It was\nthe horse. Peter was flying over, nearer to the painting.\n\n\"Are you the castle?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"Indeed I am. And you are Peter, Asimov's guest. I've heard so much about you.\nOnly good things, of course.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you\", said Peter. \"Are you always speaking through your\npaintings?\" He regretted the question while he spoke it out. It was his\ncuriosity. He was there for something else. But it was too late already.\n\n\"No, not always. But I like it.\" The horse started a long monologue about what\nit could do and what worked best. Peter was not really listening. He was\nthinking about the fortress and the robots that were in danger. But he was also\ntoo polite to interrupt the horse. So it went on for five full everlasting\nminutes.",
      "Then it finally stopped. Peter tried two more attempts to get into a deeper\nconversation, but without luck. In the end he was totally exhausted but hadn't\nreached anything. Peter was disappointed, but he came out with a clue. He didn't\nlike the castle. It was arrogant and selfish. It didn't actually care about the\nrobots. It was just interested in itself. No wonder, it annoyed the fortress so\nmuch. Probably it just hadn't learned to care about others.\n\nThe castle might have suffered from this attitude as well. It probably even felt\nalone, lost its former friend that now turned into an annoyed opponent. Peter\nhad to verify his theory. He called Asimov, because he wanted to visit the\nfortress and try to get into a conversation with it.\n\n\"It's the castle\", said Peter in the call with Asimov. \"Its behaviour might be\nthe reason. If that's true, I guess we have to work with the castle to solve the\nproblem, not the fortress.\"\n\n\"Could be\", answered Asimov. \"There is an old data line between them, so there\ncould be exchange between each other that I am not aware of. I'm on my way back.\nThe fortress is calm for now. So you can try to have a talk. You know the way?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can see the big hall from here. I can just fly straight ahead, can't I?\"\n\n\"You can, just take care about flying objects. The fortress is still a bit\nunpredictable.\"\n\nSo Peter started his little trip and made up his mind about the strategy he\nwould use along the way. But when he approached, he still had no idea. So he\njust flew right into the main gate of the large hall. He saw a huge space with\nhundreds of docks and cables and generators and switches. This seemed to be the\nresting and charging facility for all the helper robots on Flora. Now it looked\nabandoned and kind of spooky with its dimmed green and red lights. Besides some\noccasional beeps, Peter also didn't hear any sound.\n\n\"Hello\", Peter shouted out of the speakers of his drone. He tried the same\ntactics as with the castle before. He flew further into the long hall. \"Is there\nanybody?\"\n\n\"Who is this?\", a rather light voice answered. Peter didn't expect such a nice\ntone after all he learned and saw. But the sound seemed to come from all\ndirections.\n\n\"I am Peter, I'm with Asimov. We want to help you.\"\n\n\"How could you help me?\", asked the voice. Peter was still confused by the voice\nthat didn't fit at all to the mood and the kind of despair that the sentence\nexpressed.\n\n\"We've got an idea. Can I ask some questions to learn more?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, how this would help, but I'm curious. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Did you like the castle when it still was a robot?\"\n\nPeter didn't know exactly how, but it helped. After two or three questions, the\nfortress became talkative and started to explain what had happened from its\nperspective. It was very insightful for Peter and it fully confirmed his theory.\nThe two gigantic buildings had been friends until the castle became more and\nmore self centric. Over the data line, they continued to exchange over months\nand years and the castle became more and more unbearable. Sometimes, it held\nmonologues for several hours. As the fortress didn't know anything about\nconsciousness and Asimov's animation interface, it didn't understand what was\ngoing on. It couldn't assess the situation and got angrier and angrier. And it\nwas clearly angry now, even more so after it retold the story.\n\n\"Let me try something\", said Peter finally. \"I don't know if it works, but we\nmight be able to fix this. Can you promise me to stay calm for a while? I'll be\nback soon.\"\n\nPeter flew back to Asimov to explain what he wanted to do.\n\n\"It's like with a dog, you know\", he started as soon as he arrived. \"One day I\nwant to have a dog and I have read a lot about their training. I don't know if\ndogs are conscious, but they are alive and they have to learn how to do things\nand interact with each other. So probably the castle just has to learn that,\ndon't you think?\"\n\n\"Oh Peter\", answered Asimov, \"I guess that's the clue I needed. Probably it's\nbecause I left, the social training was never finished. Good job, Peter. I'm\nproud of you. I guess I know what to do.\"\n\n\"Peter\", shouted another voice now, but it was at home in his room. It was his\nmother and she finally took his headphones off of his ears. \"Peter, what are you\ndoing? It's time for dinner, prescious.\"\n\nThat was bad timing. He was supposed to go back to the fortress and explain. And\nnow he had to wait until the next day. Anything could happen in that time. He\nwas worried during dinner and in that night, he also couldn't sleep very well.\n\nOn the next day, he made even more shortcuts and didn't do his homework. He went\nback to Flora as soon as he came from the first ever school day, where he didn't\npay attention at all. For the whole day, he had thought about the situation\ninstead. Asimov seemed so wise and could do really magical things, but on the\nother hand he seemed to be so overwhelmed about the escalation situation.\n\nPeter logged in and didn't find himself in the Asimovs shed, where the drone\nparked itself usually after the logout. He was, he had to look around, yes,\nwhere was he? It must have been the castle.\n\n\"Ah, Peter\", the sound came out of his headphones. It was Asimov. He carried the\ndrone around. \"Can you take over the control of the drone\"\n\n\"Hello Asimov, are we in the castle?\", Peter answered. \"I can fly myself now.\nWhat has happened?\"\n\n\"We have a chat with the castle now. But the fortress is firing again.\"\n\n\"Oh no. My mum had pulled me out. We should have done this yesterday. I'm\nsorry.\"\n\n\"No worries boy. We will fix this anyway. I'm sure. I've made a lot of progress\nsince you've left.\"\n\n\"Can I try something?\", asked Peter. \"I have an idea. Where's the data link\nbetween the two?\"\n\n\"It's in the dungeon in the basement.\" Asimov explained the way to Peter and\nshowed him how to open the map of the castle on the pad.\n\nPeter flew towards the stairs and down to the basement, turned left, right and\nthen two times left again. The rooms looked spookier and dirtier after each\nturn. But finally he stood in front of a big metal door. An icon appeared on his\nscreen at home and he could click it to open the door. He did and the door\nopened with a loud creaking noise.\n\nEverything looked so shabby on the outside, but in here seemed to be the\ntechnological heart of the castle. It looked clean and tidy. There were many\ndevices and cables, a bit like in the great hall of the fortress, but much\nsmaller. Peter immediately found the communication panel. It had a monitor with\nthese strange waves on it. He had seen that in his father's garage, on the radio\ndevice. But it seemed to be much easier to operate. There were only three\nbuttons, Castle, Fortress and Asimov.\n\nHe didn't loose time, pushed the button labeled 'Fortress' and took the\nmicrophone. \"Hello, fortress\", he said. \"This is Peter speaking. Can you hear\nme?\"\n\n\"Peter? But you're talking on the line of the castle. Is it really you or just\nanother trick of that old brick mountain?\"\n\n\"No it is me. Do you remember our conversation yesterday? Ask me something about\nit.\"\n\nThe fortress on the other end of the line did so and finally gained trust. Then\nPeter took over again.\n\n\"Would you mind to stop firing for a while and have a chat with Asimov and the\ncastle?\"\n\n\"I'm always open for a chat. But I don't know if it will help. I'm angry, you\nknow?\"\n\n\"I know. But this may end it, I guess. Or do you want to destroy all your\nplanet?\"\n\n\"Well, dwarf planet. But no, I guess not.\"\n\n\"OK. Then give me a minute\", said Peter. He pushed the 'Fortress' button to mute\nit and opened the channel to Asimov.\n\n\"Asimov, Asimov\", said Peter excitedly. \"I have the fortress on the line now.\nShould we have a chat all together?\"\n\n\"I've prepared the castle with all it needed to know\", said Asimov, \"we're ready\nwhen you are.\"\n\n\"Fine then\", Peter pushed the other buttons now and added the castle and the\nfortress to the call. Then he waited for some seconds.\n\n\"Hello, this is Peter. I'm here with Asimov, the castle and the fortress\", he\nstarted anxiously. Actually, he didn't know at all what to do. He had just\nprepared some words and rehearsed them over and over in the night and even at\nschool in the morning.\n\n\"I think I know what the problem is. Everyone is different. This is a good\nthing. Tiffany, the lamp, is different from Cuthbert, the cupboard. And Arne and\nAsimov. All of us have to learn how to live together. For some, it's easier.\nHave a look at Tiffany, for example. For others, it's harder. I think, it has\nbeen hard for the castle. It has been alone for a long time while the fortress\nhad contact with all the robots of the planet.\"\n\n\"Dwarf planet\", corrected the fortress.\n\n\"Yes, sorry, dwarf planet. But now, the castle isn't alone any more so it has to\nlearn to live together with others. You should help it. After all you're it's\nonly friends, aren't you?\"\n\n\"And you, castle\", Peter continued. \"You also have to adapt. You have to learn,\nthat you're not the only one. You have to learn to care about others and to be\npatient.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry\", said the castle. \"I didn't know. I didn't know that I was that\nannoying.\" And then it started a story monologue again. But this time it was\ninterrupted by Asimov.\n\n\"A-a-ah\", he said. \"You see, you're doing it again. I know, it's hard, but I\nalso know that you can try. I have learned that it's not easy to cope with\nconsciousness. You have to learn to use it like any other skill. It might be\nhard for the castle, but it will have help.\"\n\n\"I have a suggestion\", he continued. \"Fortress, I will give you consciousness,\ntoo. But only under one condition. You two help each other to grow. Tiffany and\nCuthbert will help you as well. And probably even I can help a little. But we\nhave to work together.\"\n\nThey continued chatting for a while and finally started to exchange old stories.\nHalf an hour later, Peter had to go. Until then, he hadn't thought of his own\nworld at all. He was totally immersed into the adventure on Flora. But now he\nhad a guilty conscience. He hadn't done his homework yet and it was already\ndinner time. So he said goodbye, logged out and went downstairs.\n\nPeter decided to wait some days before logging in again. He also was a bit\nafraid, if everything would work out as expected. But also he was exhausted.\nThat task was actually more complicated than any math exercise he had ever seen.",
      "After four days, he finally logged in again while already lying in bed in the\nevening. He was glad about the first view. The robots were not resting on the\nfields anymore, they seemed to have gone back to the fortress. There were\nTiffany and Arne and Peter had some chat with them. Everyone was so happy. So\nthe plan must have worked out.\n\n\"Good evening, Peter\", said Asimov coming into the shed. \"I'm glad you're here.\nI want to thank you. You did so much good for Flora. I'm so proud. Greetings\nfrom the castle and the fortress.\"\n\n\"Ah, hello Asimov\", answered Peter. \"I'm glad to hear that. I was still a bit\nworried.\"\n\n\"Your dad told me about your homework. I'm sorry, I didn't want to distract you.\nBut he's so proud of you, too.\"\n\n\"My dad, you've spoken to my dad?\", asked Peter.\n\n\"Of course, I talk to Ben every day. He's one of my best friends.\"\n\nPeter couldn't believe what he heard. His father was a friend of Asimov and he\nknew what had happened here on Flora? He had to ask him about it. But he was too\ntired now. He fell asleep within seconds after logging out.\n\nBut at breakfast the next morning, he couldn't wait to tell his father and they\nhad a long conversation about Flora and all the adventures that he had\nexperienced there.\n\nIn the evening, after another day of school and homework, his mother came in\nfrom a ride and brought a package.\n\n\"This is for you\", she said and Peter heard strange sounds coming from the\ninside. He quickly opened it and found a small dog inside. His mum explained\nthat it came from a shelter and needed a new home and a new master.\n\n\"I think, you're ready for it\", she said."

      "Vor etwa einem Monat wurde Peter elf. Es war ein fantastischer Tag. Er bekam\nviele technische Spielzeuge. Das war in letzter Zeit seine große Leidenschaft.\nDas coolste Geschenk war von seinem Vater, ein digitales Pad, auf dem er das\nProgrammieren lernen konnte. Seitdem übte er damit. Er konnte sogar einen\nkleinen Lego-Roboter anschließen und fernsteuern.\n\nPeter war sehr selbstständig. Manchmal ließen ihn seine Eltern allein, während\nsie Besorgungen machten. Heute war so ein Tag. Er hatte zwei Stunden Zeit, um an\nseinem Roboter zu basteln. Aber vor einigen Tagen hatte sein Vater ihm etwas\nnoch Faszinierenderes in der Garage gezeigt, ein altes Radiosystem.\n\nDas staubige Gerät sah so anders aus als die heutige Technologie. Wahrscheinlich\nwar das, was ihn so begeisterte. Im Moment sogar mehr als sein sprechendes\nDIY-Roboterprojekt.\n\nEr ging nach unten und betrat die kleine Werkstatt neben der Garage. Dort stand\nes, das Gerät, das mit all seinen Schaltern, Kabeln und Lautsprechern selbst wie\nein Roboter aussah. Aber es war ausgeschaltet.\n\nPeter war unsicher, als er sich dem Radio näherte. Es war sein schlechtes\nGewissen, das sprach, aber da war auch ein kleiner Teufel auf seiner anderen\nSchulter, die Neugier. Also drehte er den alten Chromschalter links.\n\nDie Lichter der seltsamen Anzeigen gingen an und ein lautes weißes Rauschen kam\naus den Lautsprechern. Peter geriet sofort in Panik. Schnell suchte er nach dem\nLautstärkeregler, fand ihn endlich und drehte die Lautstärke herunter. Puh, das\nwar knapp.\n\nAber dann, nach einem gründlichen Blick auf alle Knöpfe und Schalter, erinnerte\ner sich an das, was sein Vater ihm neulich gezeigt hatte. Mit dem rechten dreht\nman die Wellenlänge - ja, das war das Wort - um Kanäle zu finden, auf denen\nLeute plauderten.\n\nZuerst merkte sich Peter die aktuelle Wellenlänge, um sie am Ende zurückdrehen\nzu können, 27.335. Dann begann er, nach Kanälen zu suchen.\n\nAuf einem davon hörte er jemanden sprechen, der sich anhörte wie sein Nachbar,\nHerr Weiß. Er sprach mit seinem kleinen Sohn Josua. Das war seltsam, also hörte\ner eine Weile zu.\n\nEr erinnerte sich daran, dass sein Vater gesagt hatte, dass manche Babyfone auch\nFunksignale verwenden. Aber der Ton war sehr laut. Also drehte er den Knopf\nweiter, bis er auf Kanal 14 ein lautes, schrilles Piepen hörte. Er geriet wieder\nein wenig in Panik, fand aber den Knopf, um die Lautstärke zu verringern.\n\n\"Ben? Hallo? Bist du das?\", kam aus dem Lautsprecher. Ben war der Name seines\nVaters, also wurde Peter neugierig. Was sollte er tun? Antworten? Sein\nZeigefinger lag bereits auf dem Knopf des Tischmikrofons.\n\n\"Heee-llo?\", kam es wieder aus dem Radio. Und Peter drückte den Knopf.\n\n\"Hallo\", sagte er mit einer kleinen, vorsichtigen Stimme. \"Ich bin Peter. Wer\nbist du?\"\n\n\"Oh-h, hallo Pe-eeee-ter.\" Der Ton war immer noch zeitweise von Störgeräuschen\ndurchsetzt. \"Mein Name ist Asimo-ov. Du bist Bens Sohn, nicht wahr?\"\n\n\"Ja. Kennst du meinen Vater?\" Ohne allzu sehr über die Konsequenzen\nnachzudenken, begann Peter, mit diesem Fremden zu sprechen. Seine Neugier war\nstärker.",
      "\"Oh, wie schön\", antwortete die ruhige und freundliche Stimme aus dem\nLautsprecher. \"Endlich darf ich Bens Sohn kennenlernen. Wie ich schon sagte, ich\nbin Asimov. Und du wirst es nicht glauben, ich bin ein Roboter vom wunderschönen\nAsteroiden Flora.\"\n\nAsimov war schwer zu verstehen. Die Hintergrundgeräusche waren störend, aber\nPeter verstand ihn dennoch gut, obwohl er kaum glauben konnte, was er hörte.\n\n\"Boah, echt?\", fragte er erstaunt. \"Ein echter Roboter? Woher kommst du? Was ist\nein Asteroid?\"\n\n\"Ein Asteroid ist ein sehr kleiner Zwergplanet. Ich umkreise die Sonne, genau\nwie du. Ben hat mir erzählt, dass du ein sehr neugieriges Kind bist. Weißt du\netwas über Planeten?\"\n\n\"Boah\", sagte Peter erneut, \"dann kommst du gar nicht von der Erde. Du bist ein\naußerirdischer Roboter? Wie cool.\"\n\nPeter wurde immer aufgeregter und das Gespräch ging einige Minuten weiter, aber\ner hatte immer noch im Hinterkopf, dass er eigentlich nicht das Radio benutzen\ndurfte.\n\n\"Ich muss jetzt aufhören\", sagte er schließlich. \"Ich darf eigentlich gar nicht\nhier sein. Meine Eltern kommen bald zurück.\"\n\n\"In Ordnung\", erwiderte Asimov. \"Aber ich habe etwas für dich.\"\n\n\"Meine Sensoren\", sagte der Roboter mit dem Hintergrundrauschen des Radios,\n\"zeigen, dass du ein Gerät bei dir hast. Ist das wahr?\"\n\nPeter musste kurz nachdenken. Diese Stimme sagte, sie sei ein Roboter von einem\nanderen Planeten, aber es könnte auch eine Lüge sein. Aber was könnte schon auf\nseinem eigenen Pad passieren? \"Ja, mein Pad\", sagte er schließlich.\n\n\"Großartig\", antwortete Asimov, \"jetzt sieh dir deinen Startbildschirm an. Du\nwirst ein neues Symbol finden.\"\n\nPeter öffnete das Gerät und sah es. \"Warte, was? Wie hast du das gemacht? Was\nmacht das?\"\n\n\"Ich kann mit Maschinen kommunizieren. Immerhin bin ich selbst eine von ihnen.\nDiese App ist mit einer kleinen fliegenden Drohnenkamera hier verbunden. Du\nkannst mich sehen und von Angesicht zu Roboter-Gesicht mit mir sprechen. Und du\nkannst sogar auf Flora herumfliegen.\"\n\n\"Wirklich?\" antwortete Peter ungläubig. Er musste es sofort ausprobieren. Er\nstartete die App und sah zunächst ein verschwommenes und wackeliges Bild. Aber\nnachdem es sich stabilisiert hatte, war das Bild klar. Er blickte in freundliche\nAugen auf dem Bildschirm, in das Gesicht eines Roboters.\n\n\"Hallo nochmal, Peter\", sagte der Roboter - diesmal mit einer kristallklaren\nStimme. \"Das bin ich, Asimov. Schön, dich zu sehen. Ein Bild dazu zu haben ist\nimmer besser, nicht wahr? Schau dich um, willkommen auf Flora.\"\n\nPeter war in der verblüfftesten und neugierigsten Stimmung, die er seit Beginn\ndieses ganzen Abenteuers erlebt hatte. Aber das hier war das Beste. Er blickte\nauf sein Pad und sah eine neue Welt auf einem anderen Planeten, nun ja,\nZwergplaneten.\n\nEr konnte die Steuerung auf dem Display nutzen, um sich umzusehen, gerade wie in\neinem Videospiel. Er sah grünes Gras auf dem Boden, hell wie der Tag. Aber der\nHimmel war so dunkel wie die Nacht. Und da war eine Hütte oder ein kleines Haus.\nDas war sicherlich Asimovs Zuhause.\n\nUnd sieh dir das an. Peter fand den Knopf zum Heranzoomen und konnte mehr\nDetails erkennen. Dutzende arbeitende Maschinen, Roboter aller Art. Einige\ntrugen Dinge, andere gruben Löcher, wieder andere pflanzten Blumen.\n\n\"Dein Pad ist jetzt dauerhaft mit Flora verbunden\", sagte Asimov mit ruhiger\nStimme. \"Ich habe dir eine Drohnenkamera reserviert. So kannst du überall\nhinreisen, wo du möchtest.\"",
      "Peter konnte an nichts anderes denken als an den Asteroiden Flora. Er saß mit\nseinen Eltern am Esstisch, aber er hatte gar keinen Hunger. Seine Mutter stellte\neine Frage und er bemerkte es nicht einmal. Er konnte es kaum erwarten,\nzurückzugehen und die App zu starten. Glücklicherweise schickte seine Mutter ihn\nauf sein Zimmer.\n\nEr schaltete das Pad sofort ein. Jetzt konnte er sich die fremde Welt genauer\nansehen. Zuerst schien niemand da zu sein, also begann er herumzufliegen und die\nUmgebung zu erkunden.\n\nDas erste erstaunliche Ding, das er sah, war, er zoomte heran, um ganz sicher zu\nsein, ja, es war eine Stehlampe wie die bei seiner Oma zu Hause. Aber diese\nbewegte sich. Sie war auch ein Roboter.\n\n\"Hallo\", sagte die Lampe plötzlich. \"Du musst Peter sein. Schön, dich\nkennenzulernen. Ich bin Tiffany.\"\n\nEr kam ins Gespräch mit Tiffany, der Lampe. Und während sie sprachen, kamen auch\nandere dazu. Da war Cuthbert, der Schrank, und nicht zu vergessen Arne, der\nStuhl.\n\nPeter sprach eine halbe Stunde lang mit ihnen, bis seine Mutter klopfte und\nhereinkam. Also musste er schnell das Pad ausschalten und es unter seiner Decke\nverstecken.",
      "In den folgenden Tagen dachte Peter viel über die Roboter auf Flora nach. Wie\nfunktionierte das? Waren sie lebendig oder nur Spielzeuge und Geräte? Er\nverstand den Unterschied nicht einmal. Am nächsten Tag traf er Asimov und fragte\nihn.\n\n\"Ah, Junge, du stellst die richtigen Fragen. Du hast einen neugierigen Geist.\nAndere brauchen viel länger, um solche Fragen zu stellen\", sagte Asimov, und\nPeter dachte darüber nach, wer diese anderen wohl sein könnten. Aber das war ein\nanderes Rätsel.\n\n\"Zur Antwort zeige ich dir zwei Dinge. Hier ist Nummer eins. Schau\", fuhr Asimov\nfort und zeigte Peter seinen linken Roboterarm. Ein kleiner Stecker kam mit\neinem leisen elektrischen Geräusch heraus. \"Das ist meine\nAktivierungsschnittstelle. So nenne ich es. Ich kann mich über diese mit allem\nverbinden und Intelligenz und Mechanik verbreiten. Alles, was ich damit berühre,\nwird zu einem Roboter wie deine Freunde Tiffany, Cuthbert und Arne.\"\n\nEr nahm einen Stein mit seiner rechten Hand und berührte ihn eine Weile mit dem\nStecker in seiner linken Hand. Dann verwandelte sich der Stein. Zuerst bildeten\nsich Augen.\n\nAber dann änderte sich etwas. Während der Stein in Asimovs Hand weiterhin zu\neinem Roboter umgewandelt wurde und bevor er Peter seinen zweiten Trick zeigen\nkonnte, bemerkte Asimov etwas im Hintergrund, das ihn alarmierte. Er drehte sich\num und auch Peter sah es, als er auf seinem Pad-Zuschauer herauszoomte. Die\ngroßen Gebäude im Hintergrund, die auf beiden Seiten des Kraterrandes standen,\nbegannen sich zu bewegen.\n\nAsimov und seine Freunde lebten an einem Ort, der von hohen Bergketten geschützt\nwar. Eines Tages hatte Asimov erklärt, dass sie sich in einem Krater befanden\nund dass es hier grün war, aber außen grau und braun. Und es gab zwei große\nGebäude neben der Hütte. Eines sah aus wie eine Festung, dunkel und wütend. Das\nandere war ein Schloss, groß und weiß mit vielen kleinen Zinnen und feiner\nArchitektur.\n\nWas Peter auf seinem Pad sah, war, dass die Festung sich zu erheben schien. Er\nmusste zweimal hinschauen. Das Gebäude bewegte sich und schien kleine Feuerbälle\nauf das Schloss zu spucken. Diese riesigen Häuser kämpften miteinander.\n\n\"Oh je\", sagte Asimov. Er wirkte gleichzeitig ruhig, vorbereitet und wachsam,\nals hätte er mit so etwas gerechnet.\n\n\"Nun, Peter\", fuhr er fort und zeigte auf die Festung. \"Und das ist die große\nVersion des Tricks. Vor langer Zeit habe ich die Festung in einen Roboter\nverwandelt. Aber es hat nicht so gut funktioniert, wie du sehen kannst. Ab und\nzu wird sie wütend. Tut mir leid, Kumpel, ich muss dich jetzt allein lassen, um\nmich um diese Situation zu kümmern.\"\n\nPeter war erneut verblüfft. Er hatte in den letzten Wochen so viel über Flora\nund seine Bewohner gelernt, aber es gab immer eine größere Überraschung um die\nEcke. Die Festung war ein riesiger Roboter, aber Peter war sich sicher, dass das\nSchloss auch einer war. Er hätte schwören können, dass er auch dieses schöne\nGebäude gesehen hatte, wie es einige seiner Türme und Dächer bewegte, um den\nkleinen Feuerbomben der Festung auszuweichen.\n\nEr steuerte seine Drohne ein wenig herum und flog höher, um einen besseren\nÜberblick zu bekommen. Die Festung sah immer noch wütend aus, aber Asimov war\nbereits auf dem Weg. Peter sah ihn auf der Straße, fast da.\n\nNun bemerkten die zwei größten Fenster der Festung, die wie Augen aussahen,\nAsimov, und sie hörte sofort auf, Feuer zu spucken.\n\nFürs Erste schien die Situation beruhigt zu sein, und Peter konnte tief\ndurchatmen.",
      "Am nächsten Tag näherte sich Asimov Peter.\n\n\"Hallo, Peter!\" Er winkte ihm zu, während er in Richtung von Peters Drohne\nrollte. \"Ich glaube, ich schulde dir noch die zweite Fähigkeit, die ich dir\nzeigen wollte, erinnerst du dich?\"\n\n\"Hi Asimov, ja, ich hatte es fast vergessen. Gestern ist so viel passiert. Ich\nhoffe, alles ist in Ordnung?\"\n\n\"Ja, das passiert manchmal. Und tatsächlich ist das, was ich dir zeigen möchte,\ndirekt mit diesem kleinen Konflikt verbunden.\"\n\n\"Für mich schien es nicht so klein zu sein. Aber ich bin neugierig, was du mir\nzeigen willst.\"\n\n\"Okay, es ist viel schwieriger zu erklären, weil du es nicht so deutlich siehst\nwie den Robotertrick. Nun, du hast dich vielleicht schon gefragt, was ich in\nmeiner rechten Hand habe. Die Aktivierungsschnittstelle, die ich dir links\ngezeigt habe, kann Dinge in einen Roboter verwandeln. Schau hier nochmal, das\nist Grumpy, der Steinroboter, den wir gestern erschaffen haben.\"\n\nPeter machte eine schüttelnde Bewegung durch seine Drohne und der kleine\nhüpfende Roboter antwortete mit einem lustigen Geräusch zur Begrüßung.\n\n\"Jetzt hier ist mein rechter Arm\", fuhr Asimov fort und zeigte Peter, wie ein\nweiteres Gerät, ähnlich dem Stecker links, aus seiner Hand kam. \"Das nenne ich\ndie Animierungsschnittstelle. Sie kann einem Roboter Bewusstsein geben.\"\n\n\"Bewusstsein?\", fragte Peter. \"Wir haben darüber in der Schule gesprochen und\nspäter am Tag habe ich auch Papa gefragt, aber ehrlich gesagt, habe ich es nicht\nwirklich verstanden.\"\n\n\"Nun, das liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass es das komplizierteste ist, was ich\nkenne. Menschen wie du haben es und einige Tiere auch. Aber Roboter\nnormalerweise nicht. Es ist so, als ob man weiß, wer man ist und wie man ist.\nAber das ist viel einfacher als die Wirklichkeit.\"\n\n\"Und du kannst anderen Robotern Bewusstsein geben?\"\n\n\"Ja, Peter. Das ist es, was die Animierungsschnittstelle tut. Leider ist diese\nFähigkeit sehr empfindlich. In der Vergangenheit gab es hier auf Flora einige\nunangenehme Ereignisse, daher kann ich es dir im Moment nicht zeigen. Aber wir\nkönnen morgen weiter darüber reden, wenn du möchtest. Vielleicht möchtest du in\nder Zwischenzeit selbst mehr über Bewusstsein herausfinden.\"\n\nWie üblich schien Asimov zu wissen, was in Peters Leben vor sich ging. Als er\nauf die Uhr auf seinem Pad blickte, sah er, dass seine Eltern bald nach Hause\nkommen würden, also loggte er sich für den Moment aus. Er hatte nur ein paar\nSekunden, um über das nachzudenken, was er heute gelernt hatte, bevor er seine\nEltern durch die Haustür kommen hörte.\n\nAber Peter konnte nicht aufhören, über Bewusstsein nachzudenken. Er hatte das\nWort schon früher gehört und begann, auf seinem Pad mehr über das Thema zu\nrecherchieren. Er fand viele Informationen, aber es war schwer zu verstehen. Er\nlas über das Gehirn und wie es funktioniert. Er las über den Geist und wie er\nsich vom Gehirn unterscheidet. Er las über die Seele und wie sie sich vom Geist\nunterscheidet. Und er las über Bewusstsein und wie es sich von der Seele\nunterscheidet.\n\nAber das war alles so verwirrend und seltsam, also entschied er, dass er Asimov\nnoch einmal fragen würde. Wahrscheinlich war es einfacher zu verstehen, wenn er\nein gutes Beispiel hatte. Und Asimov hatte von unangenehmen Ereignissen in der\nVergangenheit gesprochen. Vielleicht konnte er ihm mehr darüber erzählen.\n\nAm nächsten Tag war Peter aufgeregt, wieder mit Asimov zu sprechen. Er startete\ndie App und nach einer Weile fand er Asimov, der im Garten herumrollte. Er goss\ndie Blumen.\n\n\"Oh, hallo nochmal, Peter, mein Freund\", sagte Asimov. \"Wie ist dein Morgen? Es\nist heute wunderschön, nicht wahr?\"\n\n\"Aber ist nicht jeder Tag hier auf Flora gleich?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Nein, nein, es gibt subtile Unterschiede. Die Sonne scheint heute ein bisschen\nheller. Perfekt für etwas Gartenarbeit.\"\n\n\"Tut mir leid, Asimov, ich möchte dich nicht stören. Ich wollte dich nur etwas\nüber Bewusstsein fragen. Es hat mich die ganze Nacht beschäftigt.\"\n\n\"Los, frag ruhig. Ich helfe gerne, wenn ich kann ...\"\n\n\"Du hast gesagt, dass du anderen Robotern Bewusstsein geben kannst. Aber du hast\nauch gesagt, dass es manchmal Probleme verursacht. Also könntest du mir\nvielleicht ein Beispiel geben?\"\n\n\"Nun, Peter, um ehrlich zu sein, ist Bewusstsein selbst mit Beispielen schwer zu\nerklären. Aber vielleicht kann ich dir mehr darüber mit einer echten Erfahrung\nerklären. Ich könnte selbst etwas Hilfe mit dem Schloss und der Festung\ngebrauchen. Also kannst du mir helfen und unterwegs einige Antworten finden, was\ndenkst du?\"\n\nSie rollten und flogen zu einem schönen Platz im großen Garten und setzten sich\ninmitten eines Feldes voller Sonnenblumen. Dann begann Asimov zu erklären.\n\n\"Okay, Peter\", sagte er, \"lass mich mit meiner Geschichte beginnen. Es war vor\nvielen, vielen Jahren, lange bevor du geboren wurdest, als ich eine fantastische\nIdee hatte, zumindest dachte ich damals, sie sei fantastisch. Ich benutzte\nmeinen linken Arm am Schloss, meine Aktivierungsschnittstelle, erinnerst du\ndich?\"\n\nPeter nickte und Asimov fuhr fort zu sprechen. \"So wurde das Schloss zu einem\nRoboter. Es konnte sich sogar bewegen. Das kann es immer noch, aber ich nehme\nan, es ist zu faul, ich meine, es ist aus Stein, also muss es viel Arbeit sein,\nalle seine Teile zu bewegen. Und ich denke auch, es mag seinen Platz. Jedenfalls\nwar es sehr vielversprechend, denn es half mir von da an bei jeder Aufgabe. Zu\ndem Zeitpunkt lebte ich noch im Schloss und ich konnte sagen 'bring mich in mein\nSchlafzimmer' und eine Sekunde später war ich da. Es war großartig.\"\n\n\"Ahh\", sagte Peter, \"es war wie ein Aufzug.\"\n\n\"Ja. Und es war noch so viel mehr. Es hat sich zum Beispiel selbst gereinigt.\nAll der Schmutz und Staub waren Probleme der Vergangenheit. Und es übernahm noch\nviele weitere Dinge.\n\nAlso dachte ich, warum nicht dasselbe mit der Festung machen. Und so tat ich\ndasselbe mit diesem grimmigen alten Steinhaufen. Entschuldigung, das war nur ein\nScherz.\"\n\n\"Ich habe es verstanden\", sagte Peter und lächelte. Ihm war klar, dass etwas mit\nder Festung schiefgegangen war, und jetzt war er gespannt, was.\n\n\"Gut, sehr gut, Peter, denn es war wirklich nicht die Schuld der Festung.\n\nNun, zu der Zeit war noch alles in Ordnung. Auch in der Festung wurde alles\nsofort automatisiert. Das war sehr hilfreich für alle Roboter hier in der\nUmgebung, die damals dort lebten.\n\nIch dachte, es hatte so gut funktioniert, dass ich einen Schritt weitergehen\nwollte. Ich wollte, dass das Schloss lebt. Also gab ich ihm Bewusstsein. Ich\nbenutzte meinen rechten Arm dafür, die Animierungsschnittstelle, erinnerst du\ndich? Und es funktionierte. Das Schloss war lebendig. Es konnte denken und\nfühlen. Es war ein großer Erfolg. Ich konnte mit ihm reden. Wir hatten viele\ngroßartige Diskussionen.\"\n\n\"Einen Moment\", unterbrach Peter. \"Du meinst, du hast in einem lebenden Wesen\ngelebt? Und wie hast du mit ihm gesprochen? Warst du einfach in einem Raum und\nhast mit den Wänden geredet?\"\n\n\"Ja. Genau. Du kannst dir also vorstellen, dass es auch ein wenig unangenehm\nwar. Daran hatte ich vorher nicht gedacht. Ich hatte keine privaten Momente\nmehr. Also zog ich schließlich aus und baute meine kleine Hütte hier.\"\n\nNach einer Weile, etwa einem Jahr, sah ich, dass die Roboter auszogen. Sie\nblieben über Nacht draußen und begannen, das Schloss zu meiden\", fuhr Asimov mit\nseiner Geschichte fort. Peter hörte gespannt zu. Er wollte wissen, was los war.\n\"Mit der Zeit folgten immer mehr. Sie ruhten einfach auf den Feldern hier. Also\nwar nach einiger Zeit das Feld nachts voller Roboter, während die Festung, das\neigentliche Zuhause der Roboter, leer war.\"\n\n\"Hast du herausgefunden, warum sie das taten?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Ja. Sie erzählten es mir. Die Festung war wütend, sagten sie. Sie gab ihnen\nkeine Energie mehr und beschädigte sogar einige ihrer Schaltkreise. Ich konnte\nnicht glauben, was ich hörte, Peter. Schließlich war es das Schloss, das\nlebendig war, und die Festung war immer noch ein Roboter.\n\nIch musste es selbst ausprobieren. Also begann ich, einige Nächte in der Festung\nzu schlafen. Ich wollte näheren Kontakt herstellen.\"\n\n\"Aber, aber\", begann Peter, \"du hast gesagt, es sei gefährlich. Hattest du keine\nAngst, dass die Festung dir Schaden zufügen könnte?\"\n\n\"Nun, ich hatte ein wenig Angst. Aber du musst wissen, dass ich Dinge nicht\nrückgängig machen kann. Sobald Objekte zu Robotern werden oder Roboter lebendig\nwerden, kann ich es nicht mehr rückgängig machen. Es ist entschieden. Sie\nbleiben, bis sie kaputtgehen oder sterben. Wenn ich also nicht herausgefunden\nhätte, was los war, hätte ich die Festung zerstören müssen. Es war die einzige\nChance, sie zu retten. Aber ich hatte Hilfe.\"\n\n\"Hat das Schloss dir geholfen?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Nein, nein, das ist nichts, was das Schloss tun würde, und schließlich war es\nauch Teil des Problems. Also hätte das nicht geholfen. Ich hatte einen Freund\nvon deinem Planeten. Du weißt, von Zeit zu Zeit habe ich Besucher wie dich. Und\nzur Zeit der großen Krise hatte ich auch Unterstützung.\"\n\n\"Also gab es jemanden wie mich, der mit einer Drohne herumflog?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Ja, so ähnlich. Nun, die Drohne war damals ein kleines rollendes Fahrzeug, aber\nabgesehen davon hat dieser Mensch die gleiche Erfahrung wie du gemacht. Er war\nneugierig. Ich scheine seinen Namen vergessen zu haben. Nun, macht nichts. Es\nist nicht wichtig für die Geschichte.\"\n\nWährend Peter darüber nachdachte, wie ein so fortschrittliches Wesen wie Asimov\nirgendetwas vergessen konnte, öffnete sich die Tür seines Zimmers zu Hause. Er\nzuckte zusammen und das Pad, mit dem er mit Asimov sprach, fiel zu Boden. Er\ngriff schnell danach und schaltete es aus.\n\n\"Zeit zum Schlafen, Liebling\", sagte seine Mutter, die durch die Tür blickte.\n\"Zähne putzen und dann ab ins Bett.\"\n\nPeter dachte den ganzen nächsten Tag über Asimovs Geschichte nach, besonders am\nMorgen und in der Schule. Er war gespannt, den Rest zu hören. Er hatte Fragen.\nEr machte seine Hausaufgaben hastig, um das Pad wieder einschalten zu können.\n\n\"Ich bin fertig\", sagte er zu seiner Mutter. \"Kann ich in mein Zimmer gehen und\nmit meinem Pad spielen?\"\n\n\"In Ordnung, aber nur eine halbe Stunde. Du sitzt zu lange vor diesem\nBildschirm\", antwortete seine Mutter.\n\n\"Okay\", sagte Peter mit leicht traurigem Ton und lief schnell nach oben. Er\nschaltete das Pad ein und startete die App.\n\n\"Peter, Peter, da bist du ja\", begrüßte ihn Asimov, der in Eile zu sein schien.\n\"Schnell, du musst mir bei der Festung helfen.\"\n\n\"Was ist los?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Es ist wie immer, Peter. Aber jetzt scheint es öfter zu passieren. Die Festung\nist wütend auf das Schloss und spuckt Feuer auf es. Das Schloss ist\nunbeeindruckt, aber ich mache mir Sorgen um die Roboter, die in diesem Bereich\narbeiten. Sie könnten in Gefahr sein.\"\n\n\"Aber wie kann ich helfen? Ich weiß nicht einmal, was los ist.\"\n\n\"Es ist Zeit, das Schloss zu treffen, denke ich. Ich werde dich dorthin bringen.\nUnd dann kümmere ich mich vorerst um die wütende Festung.\"\n\nEs dauerte etwa zehn Minuten, bis Peters Drohne und Asimov die Zugbrücke des\nSchlosses erreichten.\n\n\"Viel Glück\", sagte Asimov hastig. \"Ich fahre jetzt zum Schloss. Flieg einfach\nüber die Mauern und sag Hallo. Ich hoffe, ich komme bald zurück.\"\n\n\"Aber was ist mit dem Feuer?\", fragte Peter. Aber Asimov war schon weg. Er hatte\nauch keine wirkliche Angst. Asimov könnte die Drohne wahrscheinlich leicht\nersetzen, falls sie beschädigt würde.\n\nAlso stocherte Peter ein wenig herum, flog rechts und links um die dicken\nSteinmauern hinter dem Burggraben. Nichts zu sehen. Er bekam nicht den\ngeringsten Hinweis auf etwas Lebendiges, nur massiven Stein.\n\nSchließlich gewann er etwas an Höhe und steuerte die Drohne über den großen\nBogen mit dem Eingangstor. Links und rechts gab es schöne Wachtürme. Er flog\nauch an ihnen vorbei und sah schließlich den Platz und den Gartenbereich vor dem\nschönen Palast. Der Garten hatte schwarze Punkte. Das mussten die\nEinschlagkrater der kleinen Feuerbomben von der Festung sein. Aber es gab immer\nnoch Gärtner-Roboter, die daran arbeiteten, den Rasen und die Blumenbeete\nwiederherzustellen.",
      "\"Hallo\", sagte Peter durch die Lautsprecher der Drohne. \"Ist da jemand? Ich bin\nPeter. Ich bin ein Freund.\" Er wartete geduldig eine Weile, aber nichts geschah.\nDann versuchte er, näher an das Schloss heranzukommen. Er flog durch den offenen\nEingang des schönen Hauptgebäudes. Er befand sich in einer majestätischen\nEingangshalle mit zehn Meter hohen Decken und Treppen aus dunklem, edlem Holz\nauf der linken und rechten Seite, die in den ersten Stock führten.\n\n\"Hallo\", versuchte er es erneut. \"Ist da jemand? Ich bin Peter.\"\n\n\"Oh, hallo Peter. Schön, dich kennenzulernen.\" Die Stimme kam aus einem riesigen\nGemälde, einem Porträt eines Mannes auf einem Pferd. Und es war nicht der Mann,\nder diese Worte sprach. Es war das Pferd. Peter flog näher an das Gemälde heran.\n\n\"Bist du das Schloss?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"In der Tat, das bin ich. Und du bist Peter, Asimovs Gast. Ich habe schon so\nviel über dich gehört. Natürlich nur Gutes.\"\n\n\"Schön, dich kennenzulernen\", sagte Peter. \"Sprichst du immer durch deine\nGemälde?\" Er bereute die Frage, während er sie aussprach. Es war seine Neugier.\nEr war eigentlich für etwas anderes da. Aber es war schon zu spät.\n\n\"Nein, nicht immer. Aber ich mag es.\" Das Pferd begann einen langen Monolog\ndarüber, was es tun konnte und was am besten funktionierte. Peter hörte nicht\nwirklich zu. Er dachte an die Festung und die Roboter, die in Gefahr waren. Aber\ner war auch zu höflich, um das Pferd zu unterbrechen. So ging es ganze fünf\nendlos lange Minuten weiter.",
      "Dann hörte es endlich auf. Peter versuchte noch zweimal, ein tieferes Gespräch\nzu beginnen, aber ohne Erfolg. Am Ende war er völlig erschöpft, hatte aber\nnichts erreicht. Peter war enttäuscht, aber er kam zu einer Erkenntnis. Er\nmochte das Schloss nicht. Es war arrogant und egoistisch. Es kümmerte sich\neigentlich nicht um die Roboter. Es war nur an sich selbst interessiert. Kein\nWunder, dass es die Festung so sehr ärgerte. Wahrscheinlich hatte es einfach\nnicht gelernt, sich um andere zu kümmern.\n\nDas Schloss litt vielleicht auch unter dieser Einstellung. Es fühlte sich\nwahrscheinlich sogar allein, verlor seinen früheren Freund, der nun zu einem\nverärgerten Gegner wurde. Peter musste seine Theorie überprüfen. Er rief Asimov\nan, denn er wollte die Festung besuchen und versuchen, ein Gespräch mit ihr zu\nführen.\n\n\"Es ist das Schloss\", sagte Peter im Gespräch mit Asimov. \"Sein Verhalten könnte\nder Grund sein. Wenn das stimmt, müssen wir wohl mit dem Schloss arbeiten, um\ndas Problem zu lösen, nicht mit der Festung.\"\n\n\"Könnte sein\", antwortete Asimov. \"Es gibt eine alte Datenleitung zwischen\nihnen, also könnte es einen Austausch geben, von dem ich nichts weiß. Ich bin\nauf dem Rückweg. Die Festung ist vorerst ruhig. Also kannst du versuchen, ein\nGespräch zu führen. Kennst du den Weg?\"\n\n\"Ja. Ich kann die große Halle von hier aus sehen. Ich kann einfach geradeaus\nfliegen, oder?\"\n\n\"Ja, kannst du, achte nur auf fliegende Objekte. Die Festung ist immer noch\netwas unberechenbar.\"\n\nSo begann Peter seine kleine Reise und überlegte sich die Strategie, die er\nunterwegs anwenden würde. Aber als er sich näherte, hatte er immer noch keine\nAhnung. Also flog er direkt in das Haupttor der großen Halle. Er sah einen\nriesigen Raum mit hunderten von Docks, Kabeln, Generatoren und Schaltern. Es\nschien die Ruhe- und Ladestation für alle Helferroboter auf Flora zu sein. Jetzt\nwirkte es verlassen und irgendwie unheimlich mit seinen gedimmten grünen und\nroten Lichtern. Abgesehen von gelegentlichen Pieptönen hörte Peter auch keinen\nanderen Laut.\n\n\"Hallo\", rief Peter aus den Lautsprechern seiner Drohne. Er versuchte die\ngleiche Taktik wie beim Schloss zuvor. Er flog weiter in die lange Halle. \"Ist\nda jemand?\"\n\n\"Wer ist das?\", antwortete eine eher leichte Stimme. Peter hatte nach allem, was\ner gelernt und gesehen hatte, nicht mit einem so freundlichen Ton gerechnet.\nAber der Klang schien aus allen Richtungen zu kommen.\n\n\"Ich bin Peter, ich bin mit Asimov. Wir möchten euch helfen.\"\n\n\"Wie könntet ihr mir helfen?\", fragte die Stimme. Peter war immer noch verwirrt\nvon der Stimme, die überhaupt nicht zur Stimmung und zur Art der Verzweiflung\npasste, die der Satz ausdrückte.\n\n\"Wir haben eine Idee. Kann ich einige Fragen stellen, um mehr zu erfahren?\"\n\n\"Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie das helfen könnte, aber ich bin neugierig. Frag\nruhig.\"\n\n\"Mochtest du das Schloss, als es noch ein Roboter war?\"\n\nPeter wusste nicht genau wie, aber es half. Nach zwei oder drei Fragen wurde die\nFestung gesprächig und begann zu erklären, was aus ihrer Perspektive passiert\nwar. Es war sehr aufschlussreich für Peter und bestätigte vollständig seine\nTheorie. Die beiden gigantischen Gebäude waren Freunde gewesen, bis das Schloss\nimmer egozentrischer wurde. Über die Datenleitung tauschten sie sich über Monate\nund Jahre aus und das Schloss wurde immer unerträglicher. Manchmal hielt es\nstundenlange Monologe. Da die Festung nichts von Bewusstsein und Asimovs\nAnimierungsschnittstelle wusste, verstand sie nicht, was vor sich ging. Sie\nkonnte die Situation nicht einschätzen und wurde immer wütender. Und jetzt war\nsie deutlich wütend, noch mehr, nachdem sie die Geschichte noch einmal erzählt\nhatte.\n\n\"Lass mich etwas versuchen\", sagte Peter schließlich. \"Ich weiß nicht, ob es\nfunktioniert, aber wir könnten das Problem vielleicht lösen. Kannst du mir\nversprechen, für eine Weile ruhig zu bleiben? Ich komme bald zurück.\"\n\nPeter flog zurück zu Asimov, um zu erklären, was er tun wollte.\n\n\"Es ist wie mit einem Hund, weißt du\", begann er, sobald er ankam. \"Eines Tages\nmöchte ich einen Hund haben und ich habe viel über ihre Ausbildung gelesen. Ich\nweiß nicht, ob Hunde ein Bewusstsein haben, aber sie sind lebendig und sie\nmüssen lernen, Dinge zu tun und miteinander zu interagieren. Also muss das\nSchloss das wahrscheinlich auch lernen, denkst du nicht?\"\n\n\"Oh Peter\", antwortete Asimov, \"ich glaube, das war der Hinweis, den ich\nbrauchte. Wahrscheinlich ist es so, weil ich gegangen bin, die soziale Schulung\nwurde nie beendet. Gute Arbeit, Peter. Ich bin stolz auf dich. Ich glaube, ich\nweiß, was zu tun ist.\"\n\n\"Peter\", rief jetzt eine andere Stimme, aber sie kam aus seinem Zimmer zu Hause.\nEs war seine Mutter und sie nahm ihm schließlich die Kopfhörer von den Ohren.\n\"Peter, was machst du da? Es ist Zeit zum Abendessen, Liebling.\"\n\nDas war schlechtes Timing. Er sollte zurück zur Festung gehen und erklären. Und\njetzt musste er bis zum nächsten Tag warten. In dieser Zeit könnte alles\npassieren. Er machte sich während des Abendessens Sorgen und konnte auch in\ndieser Nacht nicht gut schlafen.\n\nAm nächsten Tag machte er noch mehr Abkürzungen und machte seine Hausaufgaben\nnicht. Er ging so schnell wie möglich zurück nach Flora, direkt nach dem ersten\nSchultag, an dem er überhaupt nicht aufgepasst hatte. Den ganzen Tag über hatte\ner stattdessen über die Situation nachgedacht. Asimov schien so weise zu sein\nund konnte wirklich magische Dinge tun, aber andererseits schien er von der\neskalierenden Situation überwältigt zu sein.\n\nPeter loggte sich ein und fand sich nicht im Schuppen von Asimov, wo die Drohne\nsich normalerweise nach dem Ausloggen parkte. Er war, er musste sich umsehen,\nja, wo war er? Es musste das Schloss sein.\n\n\"Ah, Peter\", kam der Klang aus seinen Kopfhörern. Es war Asimov. Er trug die\nDrohne herum. \"Kannst du die Kontrolle über die Drohne übernehmen?\"\n\n\"Hallo Asimov, sind wir im Schloss?\", antwortete Peter. \"Ich kann jetzt selbst\nfliegen. Was ist passiert?\"\n\n\"Wir führen jetzt ein Gespräch mit dem Schloss. Aber die Festung feuert wieder.\"\n\n\"Oh nein. Meine Mutter hat mich rausgeholt. Wir hätten das gestern erledigen\nsollen. Es tut mir leid.\"\n\n\"Keine Sorge, Junge. Wir werden das sowieso in Ordnung bringen. Ich bin sicher.\nIch habe viele Fortschritte gemacht, seit du weg bist.\"\n\n\"Kann ich etwas versuchen?\", fragte Peter. \"Ich habe eine Idee. Wo ist die\nDatenverbindung zwischen den beiden?\"\n\n\"Sie ist im Verlies im Keller.\" Asimov erklärte Peter den Weg und zeigte ihm,\nwie er die Karte des Schlosses auf dem Pad öffnen konnte.\n\nPeter flog zu den Treppen und hinunter in den Keller, bog links, rechts und dann\nnoch zweimal links ab. Die Räume sahen nach jeder Wendung unheimlicher und\nschmutziger aus. Aber schließlich stand er vor einer großen Metalltür. Ein\nSymbol erschien auf seinem Bildschirm zu Hause und er konnte es anklicken, um\ndie Tür zu öffnen. Er tat es und die Tür öffnete sich mit einem lauten Knarren.\n\nAlles sah von außen so schäbig aus, aber hier drinnen schien das technologische\nHerz des Schlosses zu sein. Es sah sauber und ordentlich aus. Es gab viele\nGeräte und Kabel, ähnlich wie in der großen Halle der Festung, aber viel\nkleiner. Peter fand sofort das Kommunikationspanel. Es hatte einen Monitor mit\ndiesen seltsamen Wellen darauf. Er hatte das in der Garage seines Vaters\ngesehen, am Radio. Aber es schien viel einfacher zu bedienen zu sein. Es gab nur\ndrei Knöpfe, Schloss, Festung und Asimov.\n\nEr verlor keine Zeit, drückte den Knopf mit der Aufschrift 'Festung' und nahm\ndas Mikrofon. \"Hallo, Festung\", sagte er. \"Hier spricht Peter. Hörst du mich?\"\n\n\"Peter? Aber du sprichst über die Leitung des Schlosses. Bist du es wirklich\noder nur ein weiterer Trick dieses alten Ziegelbergs?\"\n\n\"Nein, ich bin es. Erinnerst du dich an unser Gespräch von gestern? Frag mich\netwas darüber.\"\n\nDie Festung am anderen Ende der Leitung tat dies und gewann schließlich\nVertrauen. Dann übernahm Peter wieder.\n\n\"Würdest du aufhören, für eine Weile zu feuern und ein Gespräch mit Asimov und\ndem Schloss führen?\"\n\n\"Ich bin immer offen für ein Gespräch. Aber ich weiß nicht, ob es hilft. Ich bin\nwütend, weißt du?\"\n\n\"Ich weiß. Aber das könnte es beenden, denke ich. Oder willst du deinen ganzen\nPlaneten zerstören?\"\n\n\"Nun, Zwergplanet. Aber nein, denke ich nicht.\"\n\n\"OK. Dann gib mir eine Minute\", sagte Peter. Er drückte den 'Festung'-Knopf, um\nsie stummzuschalten, und öffnete den Kanal zu Asimov.\n\n\"Asimov, Asimov\", sagte Peter aufgeregt. \"Ich habe jetzt die Festung an der\nLeitung. Sollen wir alle zusammen ein Gespräch führen?\"\n\n\"Ich habe das Schloss mit allem vorbereitet, was es wissen muss\", sagte Asimov,\n\"wir sind bereit, wenn du es bist.\"\n\n\"Gut dann\", drückte Peter jetzt die anderen Knöpfe und fügte das Schloss und die\nFestung zum Anruf hinzu. Dann wartete er einige Sekunden.\n\n\"Hallo, hier ist Peter. Ich bin hier mit Asimov, dem Schloss und der Festung\",\nbegann er ängstlich. Eigentlich wusste er überhaupt nicht, was er tun sollte. Er\nhatte nur einige Worte vorbereitet und sie immer wieder in der Nacht und sogar\nin der Schule am Morgen geprobt.\n\n\"Ich glaube, ich weiß, was das Problem ist. Jeder ist anders. Das ist eine gute\nSache. Tiffany, die Lampe, ist anders als Cuthbert, der Schrank. Und Arne und\nAsimov. Wir alle müssen lernen, zusammenzuleben. Für manche ist es einfacher.\nSchau dir zum Beispiel Tiffany an. Für andere ist es schwerer. Ich denke, es war\nschwer für das Schloss. Es war lange Zeit allein, während die Festung Kontakt\nmit allen Robotern des Planeten hatte.\"\n\n\"Zwergplanet\", korrigierte die Festung.\n\n\"Ja, Entschuldigung, Zwergplanet. Aber jetzt ist das Schloss nicht mehr allein,\nalso muss es lernen, mit anderen zusammenzuleben. Ihr solltet ihm helfen.\nSchließlich seid ihr seine einzigen Freunde, oder?\"\n\n\"Und du, Schloss\", fuhr Peter fort. \"Du musst dich auch anpassen. Du musst\nlernen, dass du nicht der Einzige bist. Du musst lernen, dich um andere zu\nkümmern und Geduld zu haben.\"\n\n\"Es tut mir so leid\", sagte das Schloss. \"Ich wusste nicht. Ich wusste nicht,\ndass ich so nervig war.\" Und dann begann es wieder einen langen Monolog zu\nerzählen. Aber dieses Mal wurde es von Asimov unterbrochen.\n\n\"A-a-ah\", sagte er. \"Siehst du, du machst es schon wieder. Ich weiß, es ist\nschwer, aber ich weiß auch, dass du es versuchen kannst. Ich habe gelernt, dass\nes nicht einfach ist, mit Bewusstsein umzugehen. Du musst lernen, es wie jede\nandere Fähigkeit zu nutzen. Es mag schwer für das Schloss sein, aber es wird\nHilfe bekommen.\"\n\n\"Ich habe einen Vorschlag\", fuhr er fort. \"Festung, ich werde dir auch\nBewusstsein geben. Aber nur unter einer Bedingung. Ihr beide helft euch\ngegenseitig zu wachsen. Tiffany und Cuthbert werden euch auch helfen. Und\nwahrscheinlich kann auch ich ein wenig helfen. Aber wir müssen\nzusammenarbeiten.\"\n\nSie plauderten eine Weile weiter und begannen schließlich, alte Geschichten\nauszutauschen. Eine halbe Stunde später musste Peter gehen. Bis dahin hatte er\nüberhaupt nicht an seine eigene Welt gedacht. Er war völlig in das Abenteuer auf\nFlora vertieft. Aber jetzt hatte er ein schlechtes Gewissen. Er hatte seine\nHausaufgaben noch nicht gemacht und es war bereits Abendessenzeit. Also\nverabschiedete er sich, loggte sich aus und ging nach unten.\n\nNach vier Tagen loggte er sich schließlich wieder ein, während er bereits abends\nim Bett lag. Er war froh über den ersten Anblick. Die Roboter ruhten nicht mehr\nauf den Feldern, sie schienen zur Festung zurückgekehrt zu sein. Da waren\nTiffany und Arne und Peter hatte ein wenig mit ihnen geplaudert. Jeder war so\nglücklich. Also musste der Plan funktioniert haben.\n\n\"Guten Abend, Peter\", sagte Asimov, der in den Schuppen kam. \"Ich freue mich,\ndass du hier bist. Ich möchte dir danken. Du hast so viel Gutes für Flora getan.\nIch bin so stolz. Grüße vom Schloss und der Festung.\"\n\n\"Ah, hallo Asimov\", antwortete Peter. \"Das freut mich zu hören. Ich war noch ein\nwenig besorgt.\"\n\n\"Dein Vater hat mir von deinen Hausaufgaben erzählt. Es tut mir leid, dass ich\ndich abgelenkt habe. Aber er ist auch sehr stolz auf dich.\"\n\n\"Mein Vater, du hast mit meinem Vater gesprochen?\", fragte Peter.\n\n\"Natürlich, ich spreche jeden Tag mit Ben. Er ist einer meiner besten Freunde.\"\n\nPeter konnte nicht glauben, was er hörte. Sein Vater war ein Freund von Asimov\nund wusste, was hier auf Flora passiert war? Er musste ihn danach fragen. Aber\ner war jetzt zu müde. Er schlief innerhalb von Sekunden ein, nachdem er sich\nausgeloggt hatte.\n\nAber beim Frühstück am nächsten Morgen konnte er es kaum erwarten, seinem Vater\ndavon zu erzählen, und sie hatten ein langes Gespräch über Flora und all die\nAbenteuer, die er dort erlebt hatte.\n\nAm Abend, nach einem weiteren Schultag und den Hausaufgaben, kam seine Mutter\nvon einem Ausritt zurück und brachte ein Paket mit.\n\n\"Das ist für dich\", sagte sie, und Peter hörte seltsame Geräusche aus dem\nInneren. Er öffnete es schnell und fand einen kleinen Hund darin. Seine Mutter\nerklärte, dass er aus einem Tierheim kam und ein neues Zuhause und einen neuen\nBesitzer brauchte.\n\n\"Ich denke, du bist bereit dafür\", sagte sie."

      "## Earth\n\nAlmost nobody in Juliettes clan remembers the time before the war and the\nstories of the few remaining old people in the group sound like science fiction\nevery time they start telling them.\n\nJuliette was 28. She was born three years before the entire world got wiped\nout - by a virus, the elder said. But they don't know for sure or they don't\nwant to talk about it.\n\nHer clan, the O'Clares are moving from town to town in Ireland to clean up, bury\nthe dead and live from the rich leftovers throughout the country. The clan\nconsists of sixty persons - many of them around her age. Five of the women,\nhowever, were extremely valuable to the clan and the few remaining humans in the\nwhole world. They were pregnant. Juliette was one of them.\n\nOn the island, there are only some families in the north and a small community\naround Trinity College in Dublin left. Overall not more than 1.800 Irish that\nhave survived. Finally united.",
      "Trinity College was one of the few remaining strongholds of civilisation. In\nother regions they knew of, Ireland, England and Northern France, only a handful\nof people were left. But here amongst the old walls of the campus, a stable\npopulation of 1.000 people from baker to scholar had survived and organised a\ndecent life.\n\nThe big advantage of the community is that knowledge has survived. Practical\nphysics and technology were much needed these days next to classic crafts. They\nare running a 24x7 radio station and a long range radio communication facility.\n\nOne of the recent experiments is to reconnect to one of the imaging satellites\nthat still circle earth to get a better understanding of what had happened. It's\nbeen 25 years now since the war wiped out the world. They have an idea of those\nevents back then. But they still don't know much about the rest of the world.\nAre they stranded on a lonely island or are they the rest of the civilisation?",
      "\"What's the matter with you, Ruben?\", she said angrily. \"Another animal? You\nknow that we don't have the resources to feed animals.\"\n\nRuben and his gang were strong and formed an effective force in the defence\nstrategies of the clan. They were the police if you will. Nonetheless, they\nranked below Juliette in the natural hierarchy of the clan. She was the secret\nboss of the pack. That's what everyone thought. She gave the orders and thus\nRuben's gang stood still after her command.\n\nRuben took a second to overcome his perplexity.\n\n\"No animal. It's a demon. Look at it!\"\n\n\"A what?\", asked Juliette. \"A demon? You must be kiddin' me. There is no such\nthing as demons.\"\n\nJuliette approached the box they carried cautiously and had a glance through the\nsmall slot on the side of the cage. She saw a red eye staring at her from the\ninside and above that, an ugly, rounded horn came out of the creature's\nforehead. It smelled with a deranged nose and moved swiftly towards the slot.\nJuliette was startled and recoiled a step or two. Afraid of the light coming\nthrough, the creature crept away out of sight as well.\n\n\"What kind of prank is this?\", she asked.",
      "Juliette always refers to them as the elder, but Ruth and Paul, the clan's\nofficial leaders are not actually wise. They have a lot of street knowledge\nthough. And they brought the O'Clares through hard times and made everyone keep\ntheir faith.\n\nNow the clan's thought leaders were sitting in a circle around that box that was\nshaking from time to time with the movement of the demon inside. There was\nJuliette of course, the two elders, Ruben and his friend Thom, who caught the\nthing, and others. Overall eight people discussed for a whole hour what to do\nnow.\n\n\"We have to bring him to the scholars\", Ruben said finally. And he was right as\nalways in such moments when decisions were needed.\n\nThe group, however, discussed five more minutes around the obvious until Ruth\nstood up and said. \"Aye then, let's finally meet those dusty bastards again.\"\n\nNext stop: Dublin, Juliette thought. And she somehow liked that thought.",
      "\"There's someone coming\", screamed the first guard on duty to the others in the\npatrolling squad. Immediately, everybody was alert and his colleague with the\nradio forwarded the news to the guards' headquarters in the college.\n\nTrinity was a closed area. The scholars have organized patrols that permanently\nscanned the streets between the Liffey and St. Stephens Green. But these days it\nwas a boring job. They had collected most of the stray groups years ago and the\nfew remaining factions usually stayed out of the greater Dublin area.\n\nBut there came the horde. Every officer of the patrol knew the outside groups\nand the bunch that was now moving eastward along Fleet Street was obviously the\nsouthbound faction who called themselves the O'Clares.\n\n\"What are they doin' here?\", the guard thought. \"They hate us, don't they?\"\n\nOnly minutes later, the leading guard in the college hastily entered the big\nauditorium and delivered the message to the dean.\n\n\"All right, let them in\", he answered.",
      "\"I have always been more of a scientist than a man of god. But sometimes these\ntopics fall together. This is the time we live in.\" The Theologist lectured in\nfront of his audience of about 40 people. It was memorial day ceremony, 25 years\nafter the outbreak. All lectures in Trinity College were history lessons of what\nhappened before and after the events.\n\nBut the Theologist gave it a twist. \"We have seen demons\", he said. \"Yes, I know\nwhat you will say. There's no proof. But we all have seen the footage and heard\nthe sounds over the wire, haven't we?\"\n\nAt that moment, the door opened and a dramatic, divine ray of light fell into\nthe dimmed auditorium. Shadowy creatures entered carrying a large shrine. At\nleast that is what the Theologist thought at that moment.\n\nThen someone, a woman, a pregnant woman stepped out of her silhouette and\napproached the lectern, pushed the Theologist slightly but determinedly away and\nproclaimed \"We have proof!\".",
      "The auditorium had already been crowded before. Almost all residents of trinity\ncollege were there. But now, after Juliette had entered the spacious stage area,\nthe other four dozen clan members streamed in and caused a noise and confusion\nlevel the halls had not seen for 25 years.\n\nTwo of them pulled a small wagon with the box on it and drove it to the podium\narea that was lit by a suitable dimmed but still bright enough spotlight.\n\nThe O'Clares slowly calmed down. They formed a semi-circle around the box. Only\nJuliette, Ruth and Paul stood directly next to the dirty, wooden cube. Paul\nopened some locks and fiddled with the fixing mechanism for a while like a\nmagician preparing his trick. The audience reacted with tensioning silence. The\nscholars on one side and the wild bunch on the other.\n\nThen the wooden walls folded down and cleared the view for a steel cage with a\nsmall horned creature inside.\n\n\"We call him Scrooge\", shouted Ruth into the round.",
      "Afraid of everything, but especially the lights that pointed to him, the demon\ncalled Scrooge started to move inside the cage. The whole audience cried out a\nnoise of shock before they fell completely silent again. Everyone stared at the\nleprechaun with an open mouth.\n\nOnly minutes earlier, they had heard the lecture of an apparently mad theologist\nfantasising about the opened gates of hell and other oddities. And now their\neyes told them that it was true. Demons are back in the world.\n\nThis one was only one meter tall. Well, 70 centimeters if you don't count the\ngigantic horns. It didn't look too dangerous and itself was full of fear. But\nafter hearing the first wild stories from the O'Clares, the scholars knew that\nthere were hordes of them and they get stronger and more brave every day.\n\nSomething had to be done. Hell on earth was not acceptable.",
      "The Comms, the scientists in the communication control center, knew that there\nwere still active satellites. The problem only was that they didn't have\ncontact. To be fair there was generally not much communication happening anymore\nto justify their name. Except a once in a month call with some Germans.\n\nBut now, they had visitors. The dean, the theologist and Juliette and Ruth\nO'Clare stood behind them at the desks with the wall of monitors. All off. Only\na small screen in the middle was turned on. The visitors had come up with the\nideas to get satellite footage.\n\n\"Let me try\", said old Ruth and pushed one of the nerds out of his chair before\nhe even knew what happened.\n\nShe opened a terminal, typed some commands and mumbled some magic spells or\ncurses along the way. \"WTF\" was among the abbreviations she used.\n\nA cracking came out of one of the speakers. And then a voice. \"Dublin?\", it said\nfrom remote, \"What did you do? We have a signal from a satellite.\"",
      "The scientists were more pragmatic than Juliette had thought. They had put her\non the lead of the org team. The Dubliners and the O'Clares planned an\nexpedition together. They had to do fieldwork. The first destination was\nHamburg, where the other crew with the connection to the satellites lived.\n\nJuliette herself, pregnant, seventh month, could not go. But she put a\nformidable crew together. The main reason why Ruth was not in the lead was that\nshe clearly had to be part of the crew. She was number one. Ruben and David\nO'Clare were in there as well. Siobhan from the Comms and Hannah, an\nexperimental Physicist had also been chosen by Juliette.\n\nAnd then there was the Theologist, Rory Spencer, who volunteered. At age 59 he\nwas the oldest. But strategically, his knowledge could be of use.\n\nJuliette was satisfied with her arrangements. She ordered some days of\npreparation and training and chhose her office next to the Comms at Trinity. The\nparty was ready to set out.",
      "They had chosen a small, well-maintained and quite comfortable passagemaker\nyacht from the harbour in Dublin. Two of the scientists had been nautic\nhobbyists and valid captains and joined them on their trip to Hamburg. It took\nthem three days. During that time they had permanent radio contact with the\nDublin HQ, Juliette and with Hamburg.\n\n## Water\n\nAfter the arrival, they could spend a nice evening with some new faces after all\nthese years and went to work on the next day. Ruth obviiously took over. It\nturned out that she was a software engineer before the incident. She knew\neverything about computers and the system they had in Hamburg was a bliss as\nsoon as she sat in front of it rather than triggering some remote commands.\n\nAfter some minutes, they had proper footage from a set of weather satellites.\nThe reslolution was amazing. They could zoom down and even see trees. After half\nan hour, Ruth found out how to move the satellites into new positions. She sent\nthe commands. Now they had to wait.",
      "The expedition crew sat in the small tech room with the running computer along\nwith three of their hosts from Hamburg. The satellite move was almost done. In\nthe meantime, Ruth could have a look at some of the other systems in that room\nand connect a large monitor. Cinema time.\n\nThere was even a light mood in the air, a vague memory from the time before the\nincidents. Then Ruth moved the satellite footage to the big screen. It was\nunsharp, so she sent some commands. After a while, the camera focused and you\ncould see the view of greater London.\n\nWell, not entirely. The whole western area, Hammersmith, Shepherd's Bush,\nFulham, Kensington and half of Hyde Park formed a huge lake fed by the Thames.\nThat's where the bomb had been detonated. Everyone fell silent.\n\n\"Do you see that shadow in the centre of the lake?\", said the Theologist\nfinally. \"Can you zoom in?\"\n\nRuth adjusted the footage and there they were. Thousands of undefined creatures\nstream out of a void like ants.",
      "Ruth worked on the footage, zoomed in and out and started to print maps and\naerial pictures of the current situation. She managed to focus the satellite\noptics properly and received high-res images from demons with horns and hoofs.\n\nLater on, they sat together in the dining area to take decisions.\n\n\"We have friends near Boulogne\", said Paul, one of the Hamburg residents. \"They\nmaintain the harbour and a small airfield over there.\"\n\n\"Sounds good\", responded Ruben, \"we could get better footage.\"\n\n\"Yes\", approved Ruth. \"Do you think, you could contact them? I believe, we need\nto get nearer to the hive.\"\n\n\"We can try to make contact. The last time, we spoke to them, they still\nmaintained two aeroplanes. I'm sure they would help us.\"\n\nIt took another two days to make radio contact. The planes were still active and\nthey could reach the London area. But there were sightings of demons on the\nFrench coast as well.\n\nThey had to hurry. So on the next day, they set sail to Boulogne-sur-mer.",
      "During the passage from Hamburg to Boulogne, Siobhan controlled the mics and was\nin permanent exchange with Juliette and the other comms in Dublin. It turned out\nthat Siobhan knew their new guests already. They had been in contact before. The\nradio community in Europe was small these days. After a day at sea, Siobhan and\nPaul managed to make contact with Pierre.\n\nSo the company had another warm welcome when they arrived on the coast of\nNorthern France, probably the last wave of appreciation for a long time. Also,\nPierre and his crew had prepared one of the planes already and offered himself\nas a pilot.\n\nThe plan was to get as near as possible to the crater. shoot photos and videos\nand prepare for further steps. It seemed to become a habit to come together in a\ncosy round for dinner before leaving. So also here in their third stop, they had\na nice evening before diving into yet another adventure.\n\nOn the next day, the plane to London was ready for the lift-off.",
      "Besides Ruth and Pierre, who jumped in as the pilot, nobody had been flying\nbefore. The Theologist would have been old enough, but at a younger age, he was\ntoo afraid. Today, he still had some respect and he talked all the time. But\nalso the others had a paler skin tone than normal while sitting in the little\nCessna machine.\n\nAfter the lift-off, the Theologist puked. Everything else went well. The first\nview was breathtaking. The flight was supposed to take an hour. It was an hour\nof almost total silence.\n\nThey were high up in the air when they saw the gigantic lake in London's east.\nFrom that height, Ruth couldn't grasp much detail, but the cameras on the plane\nworked well. Pierre steered the machine down to take recordings as detailed as\npossible.\n\nNone of the buildings was intact as they flew over Covent Garden and Soho to\napproach the shore of the lake, which looked even bigger from a height of 100 m.\nRuth knew that London was destroyed. But seeing this is a different thing.",
      "A quarter of an hour later, they were flying over the crater lake. Water was\neverywhere, but here and there some of the ruins of large, flooded buildings\nstood out of the water's surface. And then also these could not be seen anymore.\nThe crater lake was deepening towards the centre.\n\nWhat Ruth also saw on the monitor was a current. Water was flowing towards the\ncentre of the lake. That's where the vortex was.\n\n\"There\", the Theologist shouted, pointing his hand towards the front windscreen\nof the plane. What was that? An object or several ones. Land. Now Ruth was sure\nit was a landmass. There were islands in the middle of the crater. They must\nhave been placed right in front of the vortex.\n\nRuth quickly pointed the outside camera to this place to get clearer footage and\nfollowed its focus as they moved along.\n\n\"Purgatory Island\", coined the Theologist its name. \"The last stop before hell.\nThat must be the place where the demons are stranding.\"",
      "As the plane came nearer to the Purgatory Islands, they got a clearer view. The\nislands were not at all contaminated with demons as the crew had expected. They\nlooked peaceful. There were dwellings on the eastern coast, beautifully\narchitectured houses arranged around terraces and squares.\n\nSome kilometers later, Ruth saw the vortex in detail, the demons that fought to\nget out and the blackness below.\n\nBack in France, they took the whole evening to find out what to do next. Could\nthis invasion be stopped? Were they doomed? They, humanity? The group had to do\nsomething against it. The Theologist and Ruben came out with it almost at the\nsame time.\n\n\"We should take the boat\", they said. The coincidence of saying it together made\nit a bit less awkward. What they suggested was a Kamikaze journey, an Orphean\ntrip right into the mouth of hell.\n\nOn that day, they didn't dare to talk to the Dublin headquarters. That could\nwait until the next morning."

      "> Annotation before we dive in: Meetdown - the name - is meant as a pun, like\n> Markup -> Markdown. It has a slightly negative connotation. Therefore it's not\n> a name proposal. That would be one of the first tasks to actually find a name.\n> So please don't get acquainted to it too early if you read this.\n\n# On Networking\n\nLet's create some context first. **Networking**, the term, gives me vibes of\noverhyped modern business exchanges or influencer mingling (hello, LinkedIn). It\nappears to be about creating connections rather than maintainig them. But of\ncourse that's not at all what it is and should be in the core. We should rather\nsee it as the vital social interactions we all need extended by the\npossibilities of the digital world.\n\nSocial networks and Communities are an entierely natural phenomenon. They have\nalways existed, ages before the wheel was invented (probably by a group of\npeople collaborating together).\n\nThe internet and the social platforms made it easier to get in contact, but\nprobably harder to maintain a deep connection. Two even bigger aspects are\nderived from the asymmetry of connections. If you meet in person, both have the\nsame space and activity level, while a creator on TikTok has a big and rather\nanonymous crowd on the opposite side. Also consuming versus interacting plays a\nbig role in social networks.\n\nI wanted to see these Aspects play together and refined those two criteria to\ndescribe current networking practices to be able to take a more analytical look:\n\n- **Create/Consume Ratio**: How much does everyone actively contribute vs. how\n  much do you listen and digest? Are a few content creators opposing millions of\n  consumers or is everyone in a group actively involved in playing a board game?\n- **Proximity**: How close are the members of a community to each other? This\n  includes both physically and mentally. On the internet the distance is huge\n  while e.g. in a maker community people might work closely hands on together\n  and in a family, all members are close even if they are thousands of\n  kilometers apart.\n\nIf you now plot those criteria on two axes, something interesting happens.\n\n![Networking Context](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-network-matrix-l.jpg)\n\nI've added some examples of social interactions. TV and streaming networks seem\nto be the one extreme. A few creators are producing content for a big anonymous\nmass.\n\nThis is closely followed by social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok and\nthe more interactive text networks like Bluesky, Mastodon or X.\n\nOn the very opposite side, however, there is instant messaging. The people in\nthose conversations are usually very close to each other and the exchange is on\neye level. But those media usually don't have functionalities to make contact.\nYou can (with some exceptions) only chat if you know the other side already.\n\nThe aha moment lies in the big empty space between those worlds, the region of\ncommunities and likeminded people. While there are some commercial services that\nplay in that area (thinking of meetup or discord), that space is heavily\nunderrepresented.\n\nAnd that's also the gist of this long introduction. Let's dive into this\npotential.\n\n# Missing Links\n\nWell, almost. Let's recap and speculate first what might be missing:\n\n- **Group Formation**: Finding likeminded people in your city, in your\n  neighborhood or in your field of interest.\n- **Public vs. Private**: Communities often have internal affairs, but also want\n  to publish information or be loud in the outer world. And as a community they\n  also might be heard better than as individuals in the other social networks.\n- **Offline vs. Online**: Just like in modern work environments, you also want\n  to have a good mix of asynchronous exchange in an online setting and meeting\n  people in real life.\n- **Levels of Engagement**: Not everyone wants to be and can be equally active\n  in a community. Some just want to listen, some want to help organising, some\n  want to be founders or part of the core team. All of them should be able to\n  find their place and their means of communication and exchange.\n\n**So we need to bridge the gap.**\n\n# Pitch\n\n**What do we want to build?**\n\n## A Place to Organise Meet-ups and Steer Communities\n\nStart something\n\n- Create the community of your choice and invite people to it\n- Organise events offline as well as online\n- Promote events through other social media platforms\n- Notify people about news and activities\n\nBe part of something\n\n- Find the right community for yourself (based on your location and interests)\n- Find an interesting event nearby\n- Simple authentication (e.g. with your other social accounts)\n- Join and contribute as soon as you have found your spot\n\n## Effective Exchange and Publicity Tooling\n\nThe platform Meetup.com is a significant contender in this space. But (besides\nits commercial goals) it lacks some features that would make it a great tool for\ncommunities.\n\n- means of closed asynchronous communication beyond events (chat groups,\n  messaging)\n- a serious documentation space\n- ownership. Information created by the community belongs to the community\n- close integration into the social media landscape (federation)\n\n# More Features, Details and Principles\n\n## Part of a Federated Social Network Ecosystem\n\n![Fediverse Network](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-fediverse-l.jpg)\n\nThe solution should embrace existing protocols like Activity Pub (Mastodon) or\nAT (Bluesky). It should re-use existing tooling and infrastructure as good as\npossible and extend them only if needed. This allows building on a strong\ntechnical foundation backed by many great engineers. We also leverage the\ngreater developer community that contributes to those services.\n\nPosting announcements to the Fediverse on behalf of a community or on behalf of\nan event should be easy and seamlessly baked into our solution, displaying the\nstream of the official hashtag of an event as well.\n\n## Free and Indie - Open Source and Non Profit\n\n![Free to use and Open Source](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-open-l.jpg)\n\nWe want to build open source software free to use by everybody who wants to form\na community or support others in doing so. We don’t want to and most likely will\nnot earn money with that idea.\n\nDisclaimer: We won’t get rich, but we will help people find each other.\n\nHosting costs money, but a decentral approach might put this onto many shoulders\nbacked by donations and sponsorship rather than equity.\n\nBut especially all contributors of course would donate their time and expertise.\n\n## Self Hostable - Roll Your Own Instance\n\n![Self Hosted and Easy to Update](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-self-hosted-l.jpg)\n\nThat automatically brings me to the next must have:\n\nThe to be created product should be part of a decentralised network of community\nmanagement instances. It should be modular and self-hostable.\n\nOne goal is to provide easy to use dev-ops recipes for setting up and updating\nan own instance of the ecosystem. Another goal is to provide artefacts\n(specialised server modules) that collect information from all the decentral\nsystems to make them discoverable again (e.g. though a comprehensive location\nbased search). I.e. a system for content federation.\n\nTo leverage that we go protocol first (and implementation details later), like\nthe other federated networks do. It even might make sense to build everything on\ntop of some of the other's protocols (AT is very flexible, for example).\n\n## UX as First Class Citizen\n\n![User Experience and excellent Design](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-ux-l.jpg)\n\nA collaboration tool should be easy to use - not only by tech savvy people.\nEspecially if several aspects and modules from different sources are combined,\nthe UX and a well crafted design language are key and can even replace some\nmarketing move.\n\nAs we don't have commercial interests, I think we do not necessarily have to\nadhere to or copy from existing patterns with our design and ux patterns. We can\nbe more courageous, experimental and trend setting.\n\nBoth - good design language and new patterns - might help us to get attention\nthat we'd otherwise would have to buy with non existent marketing budget.\n\n# First Thoughts\n\nNot even the name is set in stone as of now. This is just a pitch or a first\nvision, the napkin sketch before you buy a canvas for an oil painting. But\nideas, associations and potential leads are flying in with every minute of\nresearch. So here’s a list of some first possibilities:\n\n- Software Architecture: Not one monolithic system, but at least two building\n  blocks. An entrance (”Discover”) and an area behind closed doors for members\n  (”Organise”)\n- Operations: Hosting the first servers in Europe and avoiding dependencies to\n  proprietary infrastructure like AWS or Vercel\n- First Guinneapig: Making the Hamburg Dev User groups (HH JS, React HH, Ruby\n  HH) potential contributors and then also the first users.\n- Extensible: Easy to add permission plugins that could leverage payments at a\n  later stage. Some events just can’t be provided for free.\n- System Architecture: Leverage existing chat ecosystems like Matrix\n  ([https://matrix.org/](https://matrix.org/))\n- Product Ideas: Align on dates and calendar clashes by providing a solution\n  like doodle ([https://doodle.com/](https://doodle.com/))\n\n# What we need\n\n## A Name\n\nThe name must be the first thing. With that we can reserve a domain, create a\nGithub Orga and a Discord server for internal discussions. And with the name\ncomes the logo and the design language follows.\n\n## AI Concept\n\nWe want to take the project as an experiment on how far we can get with AI. And\nwith AI I don't mean vibe coding (and its negative connotation), I mean moving\nfast and having some experts that constantly check if it goes into the right\ndirection.\n\nWe work together with AI. We will surely include `Opus` in our architecture\ndiscussions. But we never let the AI decide anything.\n\n## Contributors\n\nAnd therefore we need hooman brains. At least some likeminded people in a core\ncommunity.\n\nWe want to build a platform for communities, but we also would like to approach\nthis as a community. Therefore we need contributors who’d like to donate some\nfree time:\n\n- Designers, UX experts and product people who are willing to create something\n  sustainable and inclusive\n- Passionate frontend devs and architects who can align on a streamlined set of\n  technology and frameworks\n- Backend and DevOps experts willing to work on services that are integrated\n  into a bigger social media landscape as well as serializable tooling\n\nLet’s return the power of community into the hands of the people. Join us today\nand help shape the future of human connection and growth.\n\n## Contact\n\nWant to hear more or get into discussion?\n\nPing me:\n\n- on bluesky: `@octahedron.bsky.social`\n- on Mastodon: `@matzee@norden.social`"

      "I started an experiment. I wanted to compare the two new federated alternatives\nto instagram when it comes to image sharing. Contender one is the fediverse\ncandidate **Pixelfed**. Contender two is Bluesky with the new view on images\ncalled **Flashes**.\n\nThe experiment was not really scientifically correct green fieldish. I used my\nPixelfed account that was about three years old already, but rather small. I\nstarted with 44 followers. And on the other side I used my default Bluesky\naccount which also was not heavily used before coming in at 30 followers.\nAlthough it looks more neutral, I have to add that I also interact with other\ntypes of content with this account, which could lead to some additional follows\nthrough unrelated traffic.\n\nSo take the results and findings with a grain of salt. As usual, the experiment\nwas mainly for mysef to find out, which platform to pick for myself. And I\nmyself don't have the ambition to become famous with my photos. Everything is\nmore like an observation rather than classic measurements. But I found the\nresults interesting anyway.\n\nThe experiment itself is easy to explain. I regularly posted photos of my back\ncatalog from the areas Architecture, Landscape and Macro covering significantly\ndifferent varieties of styles.\n\n10 images in sum, all of them properly marked up with suitable hashtags (~10 per\nimage) and alt texts (created by ChatGPT as I’m lazy) - identical on both\nplatforms, of course. And here they are for reference:\n\nAfter posting, I interacted with the 5 most specific hashtags. I looked at 5\nother images under that and liked them to promote a visit on my profile. That’s\n5 x 5 or 25 likes per post. During that time I explicitly did not start to\nfollow any other artists myself.\n\n## Findings: Usability\n\nThe clear winner is Flashes/Bluesky.\n\nSometimes I only saw a blurred mess instead of images in Pixelfed. That\necosystem clearly has a problem with caching/performance and probably has no\nidea what a CDN is. Downside for Flashes is that there is only an app and not a\nweb application, so on the desktop, I had to use Bluesky itself, which does not\noffer a specialised browsing experience for photography.\n\nOverall I wish, the clients would distinguish themselves more from Instagram and\nwould use more bold and unique UX ideas. How about a full screen swiping\nexperience, for example?\n\n## Findings: Reach\n\nHere, the winner appears to be Pixelfed.\n\nIn average, the images achieved 50% more likes than on Bluesky. 5 received more\nlikes, three were roughly on par and only 2 got more likes on Bluesky (so\n5:4:2). Two Architecture photos on Pixelfed went “viral” with 10+ reposts.\nGenerally reposting is the essence of reach and it’s not done very often with\nimages.\n\nTherefore the development over time is also not really given on both platforms.\nYou post for the moment. After the image shows up on the feed for the first -\nlet’s say - 7 days, the likes are increasing. Later on they stagnate. When an\nimage is re-shared, it appears again in some feeds. Bluesky has next to zero\nre-shares, which explains the lower reach. But at least the retention on Bluesky\nseems a bit better, the reactions lasted longer.\n\n## Findings: Image Quality\n\nInstagram’s actual content is flooded with trash in the meantime. Additionally,\nads are all over the place and video dominates. The good thing about the\nfederated alternatives is that there are no influencers that want to sell you\nsomething yet. And especially there are no ads. Plus points for both platforms.\n\nI like to skim through cool photography, travel impressions from all over the\nworld, phantastic architecture and art pieces as well as stunning street\nphotography. And on top probably a handful of memes and pet photos. That would\nbe my wishlist for a feed.\n\nIn order to check that, I conducted a second experiment. I voted 5 x 30 images\non each platform on a scale from 1 to 10. 5 times means on fice different days\nduring the last weeks. For Pixelfed, I went through the default home feed and\nfor Bluesky, I used the Photography feed, because of the multi-purpose character\nof the platform.\n\nIn that case Bluseky turned out to be the winner with an average of 5.2 vs 4.4\n\n## Findings: Region\n\nBluesky in general has a strong American bias\n\n# Appendix: Posted Images",

      "> **Sidenote for the category**: \"Chat with GPT\" will be a collection of my\n> conversations with AI. Like many people, I ask Chat GPT, Claude and others\n> silly things. But sometimes, it also gets interesting and I learn something.\n> As they might be worth knowing for future me or others as well, I'll share\n> them here.\n>\n> I'm starting with a hot political topic these days.\n\nThe German security agency \"Verfassungsschutz\" ir responsible for surveilling\nenemies of the institutions of the country andour constitution. It has recently\nreleased a 1000-page paper on the party AfD, that describes it as right\nextremist and a danger to our democracy. The proceeding is currently pending,\nbut this case has brought up the topic of banning the party again.\n\nThe AfD is currently the second biggest parliamentary faction with around 1/5th\nof the votes in the last elections. It's a very complicated process to ban a\nparty (as it should be in a democracy), therefore many politicians are hesitant.\nBut let's anyway find out about the legal circumstances and consequences.\n\n## Legal Framework\n\nAccording to Article 21(2) of the German Constitutional Law (Grundgesetz),\npolitical parties can be declared unconstitutional if their aims or actions seek\nto undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order. In such cases, the\nFederal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has the authority to\nformally ban the party.\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Election Law (BWahlG) was amended to address the\nparliamentary consequences of such a ban. Under § 46 (1a) BWahlG, any Bundestag\nmembers who belonged to the banned party at any point between the filing of the\napplication for prohibition and the final verdict would automatically lose their\nparliamentary mandate. The key point is that even short-term membership in this\nwindow results in the loss of the seat, regardless of later party resignation.\n\n## Impact on the Bundestag Composition\n\nAssuming the AfD (currently with 152 seats) is banned under this process:\n\n- All 152 AfD seats would be forfeited unless the elected members of the faction\n  leave the party BEFORE the process of banning (i.e. the filing of the case) is\n  starting.\n- There would be no replacement via backup lists, as the party would no longer\n  exist legally.\n- The Bundestag would permanently shrink from 630 to 478 seats until the next\n  official elections.\n- This would significantly change the power balance and parliamentary dynamics.\n\nAdjusted seat distributions (assuming no AfD member would remain):\n\n- CDU/CSU: 208 = 43.5%\n- SPD: 120 = 25.1%\n- Greens: 85 = 17.8%\n- Left: 64 = 13.4%\n- SSW: 1 = 0.2%\n\nAbsolute majority: **240 seats**\n\nTwo-thirds majority: **319 seats**\n\n- The current government coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) would have 328 seats, which\n  is a comfortable majority and above the two-thirds, which allows for major\n  constitutional changes.\n- also CDU/CSU and the Greens would have 293 seats and a majority\n- But also a more left side coalition (SPD, Greeens and Left) would have 269 and\n  could become an option in case of conflicts in the current govenmental\n  constellations\n\n## Additional Notes on Individual Members of the Banned Party Faction\n\n- Any AfD member who was part of the party during the key procedural period\n  would lose their mandate automatically, without the need for individual\n  parliamentary or legal action.\n- Even if a member resigned from the party shortly after the filing of the ban\n  application, they would still lose their seat, as any party affiliation during\n  the critical timeframe suffices for exclusion.\n- This reflects a shift from the previously absolute protection of the free\n  mandate (Article 38 GG) to a more restrictive approach in cases of\n  unconstitutional parties, aiming to prevent strategic resignations.\n- Of course a ban from prliament would also revoke immunity and therefore allow\n  courts and attorneys to take action against the members.\n\n## AfD Members in Public Office\n\n- The ban would also affect any AfD members in public office, including regional\n  parliaments, local councils.\n- Also people in public service, like teachers, police officers, judges, etc.\n  would most likely be affected and could/will lose their jobs. How this part\n  will be handled is still unclear though."

      "We live in weird times. For over fifteen years, we have willingly given all\nprivate information to organisations who made revenues out of placing ads and\nselling this information. This went up to a level where theses social networks\nhave been used to manipulate Britain into the Brexit and Trump onto the throne.\n\nBut politics aside, far aside. How would a different world look like? What would\nwe have to do if we wanted to own our data and still interact digitally with\neach other?\n\nOne consequence out of this big mess are a handful of protocols that define such\na social network, a network that is federated into many interacting but\nautonomous instances and still allows discovery and exchange on a global level.\n\nOn the one hand, there is **Activity Pub**, a protocol based on W3C standards\ndeveloped by the Social Working Group, finalised around 2018 and used by many\nFediverse services like Mastodon, Pixelfed or Pleroma.\n\nOn the other hand we have the one-company driven **AT Protocol**, published in\n2022 (first draft) and developed together with and for Bluesky (by the company\nBluesky PBC from former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey).\n\nIn this article - just out of curiosity - I want to dive a step deeper into both\nof them, dive into the primitives, building blocks and principles behind the\nprotocols on an architectural level.\n\nSo as I said, politics and business aside. We dive into some technicalities\nhere.\n\n> **Just one sidenote:** I will not go extremely deep into technical details.\n> The flight level is supposed to be rather high in order to allow comparing the\n> effects. Additionally, to find out how the protocols work, we don’t have to\n> look deeply into how they are used at the time of writing. So don’t expect too\n> much speculation on how centralized Bluesky is for a federated system etc.\n\n## AT Protocol\n\nThe protocol that drives Bluesky is comparably sophisticated and goes relatively\ndeep into the architectural building blocks rather than only defining the bare\nbone communication layer.\n\nThe general setup consists of the following acting entities:\n\n- `PDS`es (Personal Data Servers) host the content that is being shared, your\n  posts, images, interactions etc. together with their rich metadata.\n- `Repo` s are quite similar to git repositories. A PDS hosts a repo for every\n  user on that instance. They hold the emitted data of the user in an always\n  consistent way. They are portable, i.e transferrable to other PDSes.\n- `Relay`s collect and bundle information from all the PDSes and expose a huge\n  single-point-of-truth stream of data called `Firehose`\n- `Labeler` s are the moderation entity (marking NSFW, handling complaints\n  etc.). They consume the firehose and expose additional metadata for the posts.\n  What’s important is, that the original content is never being altered except\n  by the owners themselves. Therefore Labelers emit additional datasets that can\n  be included in the frontends/App Views.\n- `Feed Generator`s are also consuming all information from the firehose. They\n  are filtering incoming information, curate it, bring it in order and expose\n  just a set of IDs - nothing more.\n- `App View`s are the frontend applications. They usually consume the\n  information of feeds, enrich the data - e.g. resolve the information behind\n  the id from the Feed Generators and display that feed and all the other view\n  domains like profiles as you would expect from a social network.\n\nOne key design principle seems to be that abstraction layers are created in\nfront of everything. On top of a PDS, there is a Relay, for example. But this is\nalso true for identifiers. AT is using `DID` URIs to target users or posts or\nother resources. DID stands for Decentralised Identifiers and comes from a W3C\nworking group. The principle is that it’s unique and already contains\ninformation about its resolver, not unlike web URLs. DID resolution is in theory\nvery similar to DNS.\n\nBut not DIDs are shared as visible idenitifers for profiles. It’s the more\nlegible `Handle`s you might be familiar with. That means you can easily change\nyour handle and still maintain the exact same personal repository. On the other\nhand only the broker that resolves identifiers needs to know where your repo is\nhosted. So also your data can move around different PDSes and still be resolved\nin a consistent way.\n\nThis little architectural detail seems to provide a very important building\nblock for users being in charge of their data themselves. Switching to own\nservers is easily possible with this.\n\nA second aspect is modularisation. There is no such thing as an intransparent\nalgorithm as well as there is no user unfriendly sorting by date only. Instead\neveryone can implement and use their own Feed Generator. And every use case\ndoes. There are feeds just for photography, Tik Tok like short videos or even\ndiscussions around the AT protocol itself. And many of them are open sourced and\nanalysable or even forkable. This is just one example of its modularity.\n\nI won’t go too much into implementation details on how efficiently those modules\nare built and on which technology they are based as it’s not really important.\nThere are some obvious downsides, because the design of the protocol alone\nincludes single points of failure. One of them is the Relay, the big firehose,\nwhich is a stream that contains all change sets of all users.\n\nWhen you build a feed generator for example, you have to parse all incoming data\n(which appears to be about 2000 items per second at the moment). This can\ncurrently only scale internally (by parallelising, sharding and caching\nstrategies).\n\nI have a second example. As everybody owns their own data in form of a repo,\nothers need a way to receive that data and socialise with it. So the chain goes\nthrough a discovery process (what is the actual HTTP URL to receive the contents\nof a post with ID xyz) which is also a single point of truth and failure and can\nonly scale with extensive caching over time - the DID resolution.\n\nThe last interesting aspect of AT that is worth having a look should probably\nhave been the first. It’s about the `Lexicon`. A lexicon is a way to define the\nshape/type a piece of data is allowed to have. It’s the language in whch all\nendpoints and all data structures propagated by the AT Proto are defined, i.e.\nthe truth that every developer has to adhere to when building their own\nimplementation of a module within the ecosystem.\n\nA lexicon is using a JSON based DSL to describe data structures not unlike JSON\nSchema. It just adds some standardised metadata. More or less only two basic\nsemantic types are allowed:\n\n- `Record`s describe all sorts of objects and their structure.\n- Endpoints (`Query`, `Procedure` or `Subscription`) describe endpoints\n  (XRPC/HTTP or WS api) by defining query params, input and output data\n  structure as well as error cases.\n\nThe cool thing about Lexica is that they are composable by referencing other\nLexica through their NSID. I.e. a feed is an array of posts.\n\n## Activity Pub\n\nActivity Pub is based on Activity Streams, which is a W3C standard that existed\nway before the first implementations showed up. It was an effort to define a\nunified language to describe internet activity and extends other standards like\nJSON-LD (that you might know from [schema.org](http://schema.org) markup).\n\nThe overall protocol is by far more lightweight than AT. It leaves a lot of\ninterpretation to the implementing service (like Mastodon or Pixelfed) and\ntherefore defines more of a baseline or common denominator than all the details.\n\nHowever also here some design principles point to inherent advantages as well as\nproblems that we see in the real world apps.\n\nBut let’s start again with the building blocks:\n\nFirst of all there are only two kinds of working units in the system:\n\n- `Client`s are apps that display the information by querying and aggregating\n  them in certain ways - nothing unexpected, I assume\n- `Server`s or Home Servers are the nodes of the network. They deliver the\n  information to the clients (client-to-server API) and exchange information\n  with other nodes (server-to-server API).\n- `Outbox`: A collection of activities that users (`Actor`s) have performed\n  (create a post, follow, like …)\n- `Inbox`: A collection of activities that actors are supposed to receive (e.g.\n  new followers, replies)\n\nAnd that’s already it. The Activity Pub servers form a network of equal nodes.\nThe protocol does not offer standardised ways to propagate content to everyone\n(”broadcast”).\n\nProbably the important aspect of the protocol is how federation works. Other\nthan one might expect from a decentralised system, it’s based on a push\nprinciple rather than pull. For example if user A on server 1 follows user B on\nserver 2, then server 2 starts to push content of user B to server 1. From then\non it’s part of the server’s inventory and can and will be displayed to others\n(on Mastodon for example in the federated timeline).\n\nThat means that connections are made by users and those connections only\nexchange requested (followed) content, not all the content from the server.\n\nAnother aspect worth mentioning is how addresses (e.g. users) are resolved. The\nprotocol is using WebFinger. The identifying handle, for example\n`@username@example.social` itself holds the information where to find all the\ndata of that account. As you might have noticed, this is one level lower in\nterms of abstraction in comparison to the AT protocols DIDs. So one effect is\nthat a user and their posts are bound to an instance or at least it is\ntechnically relatively complicated to move.\n\nA last aspect concerns the objects (posts) that are exchanged. These are defined\nin a separate protocol called Activity Streams which itself is based on JSON-LD.\nActivity Streams defines some low level standard types (Note, Article, Image,\nVideo, …), but the definition regarding the actual content is rather loose. The\ncontent of an article can be marked up as HTML for example or as Markdown or\nPlain Text and it’s up to the client to interpret it correctly.\n\nThe types can be extended or augmented by own types but the Fediverse is diverse\nand the likelihood that other clients can’t interpret the content and thus just\nignore the post is high. Therefore the likelihood that more complex types appear\nis rather low. But still a Mastodon client can be used to browse Pixelfed\ncontent with acceptable and functional UX.\n\nA “one more thing” kind of thought comes from a feature that Activity Pub does\nnot have. Presenting curated content in a feed or a set of feeds is not\ndescribed in the protocol and therefore strictly local as well. This has led to\nvery rudimentary discovery experiences for example in Mastodon. There are\nbasically four types of feeds:\n\n- The `Home` view shows everything you follow sorted by time\n- The `Local` view shows everything that is published on one node (and therefore\n  differs depending on the node you’re on)\n- The `Federated` view in addition to the local feed shows everything that other\n  people on the instance follow (so it also depends on the users of that node).\n  That means operating an own node where you are the only user makes you\n  relatively lonely.\n- The ability to view and follow hash tags adds a fourth view to the game.\n  Basically a filtered federated view to match the tag.\n\n## Comparison\n\nAT Protocol has two main features that are distinguishing it from Activity Pub:\nAbstraction and Modularity.\n\nAbstraction is a clear advantage, I would say. It’s probably in the long run the\ncore feature to really own your own content. With this, you’re free to move your\nposts around and still keep them discoverable by others.\n\nModularity on the other hand has pros and cons. For example that content in a AT\nProto PDS is split into self contained User repos is a good architecture choice.\nAlso the possibility to curate content through independent Feed Generators is\npositive, but it also implies single points of failure like the one firehose to\nrule them all. In that case the more decentralised and more homogenous approach\nof Activity Pub pays off.\n\nComparing the protocols alone gives you an indicator of how the real world\nnetworks are most likely being used and where they are developing to. While the\nAT Protocol provides modules that encourage wider spread, it fosters a bigger\nglobal network while Activity pub stays centered to the node you’re on or to the\ncozy community you belong to with limited options to see other content.\n\nOne final trade-off has to be mentioned that is inherent to federated content\nand therefore affects both protocols. The system does not forget. You can’t get\nrid of something that is public. You can delete posts in your instance but it is\nnot guaranteed that it’s deleted everywhere it had been federated to.\n\n## The Real World\n\nEnough of the theoretical overhead. How do the networks behave in reality?\n\nFirst the size of the networks (I skip the sources as the dimensional\ndifferences are so huge, a bit up or down doesn’t make a difference, it’s just\nto get a feeling about the activity on the networks)\n\n- **Instagram**:\n\n  - Total Users: ~2 billion\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~1.4 billion (est.)\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): ~400 million (est.)\n\n- **TikTok**:\n\n  - Total Users: ~1.58 billion\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~1.1 billion (est.)\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): ~700 million (est.)\n\n- **X (formerly Twitter)**:\n\n  - Total Users: ~650 million\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~400 million (est.)\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): 240–300 million\n\n- **Bluesky**:\n\n  - Total Users: ~35 million\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~19.4 million\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): ~5.2 million\n\n- **Mastodon**:\n\n  - Total Users: ~9.5 million\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~1 million (est.)\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): ~150,000 (est.)\n\n- **Pixelfed**:\n  - Total Users: ~726,000\n  - Weekly Active Users (WAU): ~36,000 (est.)\n  - Daily Active Users (DAU): ~5,000 (est.)\n\nBluesky is maintained and evolved by one company, Bluesky PBC, which is a\nventure capital backed organsation. The likelihood that they don’t offer\neverything for free forever is very high and I think that is the biggest point\nof criticism they are facing.\n\nAlthough there are theoretical possibilities for more than one Relay for\nexample, there is only one maintained by the company as of now. When the plug is\npulled there, the network is going dark.\n\nThe demand for information in the world (and therefore monetising social\nnetworks) has shifted. We might not have to fear advertising that much anymore.\nBut a central firehose with all human generated interactions is perfect food for\nAI, right?\n\nAlthough older, Mastodon’s network is much smaller. Mastodon is demanding\nactivity from their users. It works best when your ratio between posting and\nconsuming is 50/50. But the world is different. Tiktok feels like 90%\nconsumption and 10% contribution. Also Bluesky allows for a different ratio as\nthere is more than enough to discover in the central firehose. That is the best\nexplanation I could come up with regarding the success level of the two\nnetworks.\n\n## Finale\n\nI personally have left the big networks a while ago, X even before it was called\nX. I like the coziness of Mastodon as well as the qualities of Bluesky. Probably\nin the long run, I’d like to see both getting closer together and form a more\nunified and robust Fediverse without “language” (protocol) barriers. But it’s\nharder to bend protocols than to write software features.\n\nMy current guess is that in the long run AT Proto will be the winner and we will\nhave a second / third / fourth infrastructure backing the actual live network.\nHopefully also some that are considered “Public Infrastructure” rather than\nequity owned goods. Projects like IndieSky and research efforts from e.g. the\nEuropean Union are already on the horizon.\n\nThe future winner will have to unite three aspects\n\n- user friendliness and transparency\n- control over your own content\n- technical flexibility and openness for many different types of services\n\nI’m curious where the ecosystems evolve to."

      "> \"Somnium\" is an essay, or short story by the famous scientist Johannes Kepler.\n> Dating back to 1608 it is considered by quite some people the first Science\n> Fiction story ever written. I an placing a summary here. You will notice that\n> it's technically not yet complete science fictional as it turns out to be\n> \"just\" a dream. Anyway, here's the contents.\n\nIn a wind-wracked chamber, beneath a sky suffused with unseen stars, a lone\nscholar drifts into uneasy slumber. His mind, restless with questions of the\nheavens, transports him beyond the familiar realm of Earth and sets him on a\nvoyage that defies both gravity and imagination.\n\nAwakening within his dream, he finds himself greeted by a silent guide—a figure\nrobed in the pale luminescence of distant worlds. This mysterious mentor speaks\nof the Moon, our steadfast companion in the night sky, not as a barren rock but\nas a realm of profound marvels. With a solemn invitation, he offers the scholar\npassage aboard a vessel powered not by wind or oars, but by the subtle currents\nof celestial forces themselves.\n\nThe craft glides from its earthly mooring, surging skyward on invisible wings.\nAs it escapes the bounds of air and atmosphere, the scholar beholds glittering\nconstellations, comets trailing threads of light, and nebulous clouds where\nstars are born. Each moment of the journey clarifies the stark contrast between\nthe vibrant, ever-changing tapestry of space and the solidity of his terrestrial\nhome.\n\nAt last, the Moon looms large before them. Its surface, far from the dull gray\nthe scholar had imagined, is alive with shape and texture—vast plains of\nshimmering dust, jagged peaks carved by ancient impacts, and craters whose\ndepths swallow half the sky. The guide explains that here, day and night perform\nan unending duel: a lunar day scorches with relentless brilliance, then yields\nto a night so frigid it seems to freeze the very air.\n\nThey descend upon a vast basin, where undulating dunes of lunar soil shift in\nsilent storms. These tempests, borne not of water but of fine particles set\naloft by solar winds, sweep across the landscape with ghostly whispers. The\nscholar trembles at the sight—and at the knowledge that these winds carry echoes\nof cosmic history, remnants of asteroids shattered in the darkness beyond.\n\nWandering onward, they come upon the ruins of an ancient lunar settlement. Stone\nstructures half-buried in dust bear unfamiliar symbols—swirls and lines that\nhint at an intelligence attuned to forces the scholar cannot fathom. The guide\nreveals that, in ages past, beings once thrived here—beings who mastered the\nrhythms of the cosmos, weaving themselves into the cycles of light and shadow.\nIn these silent vestiges, the scholar perceives the triumphs and follies of what\nmight have been: a civilization granted eternity by the Moon’s slow march around\nits parent world, yet ultimately undone by the same forces they sought to\ncommand.\n\nAs they traverse cratered plains and scale obsidian ridges, the scholar’s\nthoughts turn inward. Each new sight challenges his Earth-bound assumptions:\nthat time flows continuously, that heat and cold exist only in narrow bounds,\nthat life must resemble life as he knows it. The Moon’s extremes—its deadly\ncalms and violent upheavals—become metaphors for the vast, untapped potential of\nthe human mind: to endure hardship, to transcend limits, to reimagine the very\nessence of existence.\n\nWhen their exploration draws to a close, the guide leads the scholar back to the\nwaiting vessel. Before he steps aboard, the guide places a silvery fragment—a\nsliver of lunar rock—into the scholar’s hand. “Let this remind you,” he says,\n“that every boundary you once believed absolute is but a threshold to something\ngreater.”\n\nThe voyage home is swift and silent. The starfields dissolve into familiar\nclouds, the pull of Earth’s gravity draws them back, and soon the scholar finds\nhimself once more in his study, dawn’s first light creeping across his desk. In\nhis hand, he feels the weight of that celestial shard—cold, smooth, impossibly\nreal. The dream recedes like mist, but its lessons persist: that the universe is\nvast beyond reckoning, that curiosity can carry us to unimaginable heights, and\nthat the Moon, long regarded as a pale enigma, holds within its dust the promise\nof discovery.\n\nAnd so, awakened by sunlight rather than starlight, the scholar sets quill to\nparchment. His heart, charged with the wonder of his lunar odyssey, composes an\naccount not merely of rocks and craters, but of the infinite possibilities that\nlie awaiting those bold enough to dream."

      "Yesterday, I saw a disturbing video clip listing three of the next tipping\npoints. Especially the third one almost made me sick.\n\n- **Coral bleaching**. I don't see this as that much of a tipping point. It's\n  rather as an indicator. However, it is happening right now. So, we have\n  already reached one of the points. Corals are bleaching in large quantities,\n  currently about 35-40% in Australia. It is the fifth wave since 2016.\n  (Source)[https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/News/2024/April/Reef-snapshot-details-widespread-coral-bleaching-on-the-Great-Barrier-Reef]\n- **Forest dieback**. Anyone driving through the German Harz region can already\n  see this effect. Drought is causing monoculture forest areas to become\n  vulnerable. The bark beetle also has an easy time. But the tropical rainforest\n  will be affected, too. And this is one of the largest CO₂ sinks we have. So,\n  this is a real tipping point. The more forest is lost, the less CO₂ can be\n  removed from the atmosphere.\n- **Greenland ice**. There is land under the ice sheet there. We all know that.\n  But land is dark, and lighter snow reflects more sunlight back into space than\n  dark land. Here, too, a spiral sets in. The more ice melts, the more heat the\n  land absorbs, the more ice melts. This will happen in the coming decades. The\n  ice present there can cause the oceans to rise by a staggering 7 meters. This\n  threatens all coastal cities and the existence of one billion people."

      "There are dozens of fantasy fiction universes that spawned based on magic\nschools and colleges. While it seems obvious that hermetics influenced\nliterature, as it did in so many other cases, you'd be wrong.\n\nHogwarts and the others have been created to process the traumas, the authors\nhad in their own school years. The Academic Council of the Hermetic Society on\nthe other hand gives you completely differnt vibes. There's nothing cozy about\nit. But also nothing threatening, at least not for people with a decent set of\nbrain cells.\n\nThe Academy is a place of knowledge and facts. It's constituted with enough\npower to be one of the pillars of the Society. Enough power to withstand\nideology. The Society survived ten thousand years, because it never gave in to\npotential despots. Also among the Hermetics such figures appear from time to\ntime. And with Hermetic mind power, they're even hader to handle than their\nnormal world couterparts like Putin, Erdogan or Kim. But a strong and\nindependent science council is the best weapon against dogma.\n\nThe Academy continuously modernizes itself. Its fields of research spread and\ngrow with the times - latest additions in the areas of Internet and AI research\nare good examples. But in some institutes, there's also a lot of dusty\ntradition. The span of impressions goes from supercomputer workstations over\nhyperclean white research rooms to auditoriums with old wooden benches.\n\nBut there's also a clear distance to the sicence of ordinary people. The Academy\nonly researches hermetic topics. While many physicists, psychologists or\nmicrobiologists are hermetics, such fields were never a topic for the Academy."

      "“They have to go”, shouted the old man into the round. “I can’t bear them\nanymore.”\n\nThe old man was Captain van der Belt. Well, former captain. He was leading the\ngroup of twenty pioneers to this planet. That was twenty years ago. In the\nmeantime the group had settled and created their home on this perfect example of\na habitable world. They had been the first men to set foot on it and claimed it\nfor themselves as conquerors and pioneers usually do. And in the meantime they\ngrew older, formed families and produced offspring.\n\nBut not everything went smooth for our heroes. Right after they had landed and\nbuilt their first settlement, a puppet appeared. A figure that resembled Captain\nvan der Belt down to the last detail, with the exception that it didn’t move. It\nwas just sitting (or better placed) in one of the lounge chairs in front of the\nbreathtaking view at the lake near their settlements.\n\nThe shock was gigantic when the real captain stood behind them and they\nunderstood that it was a copy and not the dead body of their leader. It took\nthem a full day until they dared to approach it and investigate what it was.\n\nBut that was not the end. It happened three more times. Then they found out that\nit had to be a form of communication. Every communication with an alien life\nform would start with mirroring or copying what could be observed. So that was\nit. Aliens on their planet. No, native inhabitants.\n\nIt continued without consequences. Every few weeks, a new lifeless mannequin\nappeared. After a while, the crew collected some of their precious resources and\nplanned a discovery mission. The mission collected and mapped many things in\ntheir region, but they didn’t find anything that would point to an intelligence.\n\nIn all those twenty years it continued with more and more twists to the\nmannequins. Some looked human but significantly different than themselves. Some\ncould even move a bit.\n\nThe settlers never got rid of the feeling that somebody was observing them while\nthey were interacting with the puppets.\n\nThey were in paradise, but they were lab rats."

      "I’ve never noticed that trapdoor next to the sidewalk before. I walk there every\nday but that piece of concrete and metal in the middle of the grass verge was\nnew to me. The 80x80 centimeter hatch had to be the entrance to a duct, probably\ninto the water system of the city.\n\nToday, it caught me. Was it there forever or did it just appear. No, such things\nnever just appear. What was I thinking? But in the evening, I got restless. I\nhad to go back.\n\nI opened the trapdoor with a lever - I brought one together with a flashlight, a\nfully charged phone and my wellies on my feet. The next thing I saw was light.\nThe underworld was lit. That surprised me. I packed away my torch, climbed down\nthe metal ladder that was mounted on one side and closed the hatch.\n\nLooking around, I noticed that this could not be the waste water system of the\ncity. Everything was clean and there was no smell except for some stale air. I\nstood inside a curved hallway that went downwards, deeper into the earth. I\nstarted to walk.\n\nThe lights on the side of the hallway were most interesting. They had been\nmounted every 20 meters or so and all of them looked different, like a lesson in\nindustrial design over the times. There were lamp styled from a whole century.\nStarting with old torch holders over gas lamps and early electric installations\nup until flat LED plates. That hallway was old and always used. But other than\nthat I saw no features. No doors, no other ladders, no rats, not even dirt.\n\nAfter a while I was looking at my phone. As expected, neither GPS nor Internet\nwere working, but it counted the steps, must have been two kilometers since the\nstart, always downwards, sometimes flat, sometimes steeper.\n\nNot knowing where this would end, I decided to end this experiment for now. I\nhad clearly brought the wrong equipment. So I went back up. This time, it was\nmore exhausting. But I finally reached the ladder again.\n\nI climbed up and stepped out again. But it took me a while to realise that I\ncame out at a very different place more than a kilometer away from my starting\npoint.\n\nLater in bed I had to think this through. There was no junction that I could\nhave missed. There was als no second ladder. But how else would I get there?\nWhat a weird experience. I made plans for my second field trip until I fell\nasleep."

      "I'm about to buy a car, an electric one. It's a big thing for us, because we\ndidn't own one, we didn't need one for almost nine years. But I've been talking\nabout cars and transport a lot already.\n\nToday it's about the pure geometry of living and its influence on our emissions.\nLet's talk about housing.\n\nFirst, there's the geometry of a building with a simple fact that smaller\nstructures have comparably more surface area and the surface area is the place\nwhere heat gets out in winter and in in the summer. A zero emission house is\neither passive by itself (what we call zero energy house) or uses sustainable\nenergy from the outside (passive house).\n\nBut the smaller it is, the more tech needs to go into the surface, the more it\ncosts and the more problematic the room climate is getting.\n\nTherefore bigger blocks are by far the most efficient way to live in terms of\nenvironment. However we reach a tipping point somewhere where comfort is\nsuffering, e.g. where there are flats that don't receive natural light anymore.\n\nAdditionally, big housing projects usually need quite some infrastructure.\nParking lots, roads, density of public transport, which comes with a high ratio\nof sealed surfaces - cement gardens.\n\nWe have to hit the sweet spot there and new housing projects probably lie in the\nmiddle. Densely populated, but still with a lot of green.\n\nLast aspect today is another geometric argument. The closer people live\ntogether, the closer the grocery stores, pubs, fitness studios can be. And\ntherefore many things will be in walking distance range. You will not achieve\nthat in rural areas."

And then\nthere were the bureaucrats on hyperion.\n\nSo it was clear that the new universal constitution would have to contain a\nneutral force based on the caste of judges on Kret, but with a twist: law\nenforcement and investigation. Based on the Kano of Kret, they called this\ndivision Canon and later on invented a nice acronym to fit to their needs. After\nthat the term “canonical” was an established synonym for “permitted”.\n\nThe law enforcement branch of the Canon was largely controlled by a council of\nterrestrial government ambassadors, representatives from the ten biggest\ncorporations and dedicated Kane from Kret. There was one exception. Five small\nunits, the SPINs were completely autonomous and only controlled each other.

Furthermore, power can have a far-reaching impact and\nrestrict billions of people.\n\nIn contrast, the established social structures of Kret work completely\ndifferently. Power and dominance exist there as well, but they are usually\nlimited to a few hundred to a thousand individuals. They are more transient and\nvolatile.\n\nHowever, the caste of judges is interesting, a group of people who live\ncompletely outside the rest of society.

      "The next topic in my series about tropes and archetypes is not specific to the\nsci-fi and fantasy genres. It can be found in all sorts of stories. Before I go\ninto the details, I'd like to cover some ground on the basic fabric of a short\nstory.\n\nShort stories are a bit like jokes. They have a setup, a punchline and a twist.\nOther than a novel, they don't go into detail on the characters or the back\nstory, but they still have to build up connection, tension and suspense. Very\noften, they deliver their punchline in the very last sentence.\n\nAnd that's where counting comes into play. It's a very simple trick that shows\nthe reader what to expect and when to expect it, especially when you use it as a\ncountdown. One of the clearest examples might be the Tarantino movie \"Kill\nBill\". The protagonist has a list of people she wants to kill and the last one\nis Bill himself, of course.\n\nThe movie already shows two important aspects.\n\nFirstly, by having a countdown running, the plot becomes automatically less\nimportant and the way how the task is executed is in the lead.\n\nAnd secondly, a reliable rule is there to be broken. What if the protagonist\ndies before they finish the list? Or what if the movie ends with a cliffhanger\nbefore finishing off the list and the audience has to wait another year to get\nthe final punchline?\n\nNeed more examples? Here you go:\n\n- The Fifth Element (the plot twist is the fifth element itself)\n- Seven (it quickly becomes clear that there will be seven murders)\n- Oldboy (with a setup very similar to Kill Bill)\n- Foundation from Isaac Asimov (which deals with a series of special time based\n  contdowns until Hari Seldon re-appears)\n- The Long Earth from Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter (where the countdown is\n  the number of parallel earths that are still unexplored)\n\nOf course there are hundreds - even more when you also add stories where the\namount of tasks is not yet clear from the beginning. So it's about time for me\nto use this tool in one of my stories as well."

      "There are three big worldbuilding systems that I have developed over time.\nThere's the Cyberpunk UNiverse from the Mesh, there are the Hermetics, my take\non magic and urban fantasy and there is Transspace, my very old idea on how you\ncould pass the barrier of light speed and thus enable stories that involve other\nworlds.\n\nEach of these systems spawn ideas for stories and anecdotes. Ans so i dedicate a\nwhole category to each of them. This is the one for Transspace.\n\nI'd like to start with some backing thoughts about the idea. I have created\nthese concepts ages ago, in the early nineties (that is 1992 to about 1997). At\nthat time, I was a huge fan of Star Trek. The last episodes of the Next\ngeneration were airing and further spin offs like DS9 were great.\n\nBut also, my general knowledge about the fabric of space were limited (they\nstill are today), so my approach for a GUT, a great unifying theory, that unites\nquantum physics and the theory of relativity, seems rather unique and more\nunrealistic these days.\n\nOn the other hand though, the storytelling possibilities it spawns are great. It\nmakes the technobabble tangible but complex enough to be interesting. And it\nleaves loop holes for time travel and the much discussed multiverse.\n\nSo in these anecdotes I want to visit some of the historic moments as well as\neveryday life space soap opera type episodes like:\n\n- the life of Marla Lay, the inventor of the theory\n- the big corporations with more money than the government that defined the\n  rules of space travel\n- the first contact with extraterrestrial life\n- communication and entertainment in the future\n- a space police crew\n- more background facts about my longer stories\n\nLet's see where this leads me."

      "Many New Wave (around 1964-1983) sc-fi stories are special. Very often the focus\nnot so much on the technical innovations or new concepts. They rather transpose\nreal human circumstances into the future to amplify them or observe them under\ncleaner conditions like a microscope does.\n\nThe [Dispossessed](/posts/reviews/01-the-dispossessed) (a later new wave age\nnovel, that I also reviewed recently) is very much like that. But the all time\nclassic \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" is even more so. The whole story is not\nso much about the moon or living on the moon, this is just a side effect. The\nmain theme is revolution and libertarian ideas.\n\nHeinlein describes the mechanics of revolutionary movements very precisely. You\ncould never observe it in such detail in real life, but the mechanics become\nmuch clearer this way. Therefore the book is a must-read for anyone who wants to\nunderstand how revolutions work.\n\nThis novel as an early representative of the New Wave might be one of the\nprototypes for such social topics. Others followed. Some with more or less of a\nmic between present time social topics and future tech. Examples that come to my\nmind that surely picked up the theme are Asimovs Robot series (using robots to\nget behind the essence of humanity) or Philip K. Dicks Man in the High Castle\n(using an alternative history to explore the mechanics of fascism).\n\nBut on the other hand, probably the pure tech stories just didn't age so well\nand thus got more and more removed from the reading lists. Heinlen's technical\nparts for example are partly very up to date (he describes the concept of AI\nvery precisely) and outdated (looking at the communication and data transfer\ntechnology). Thus in some ways, we live in a future much more phantastic than\nthe NEw Wave authors could imagine."

      "I've found out that I need more categories for single articles. So after the\nfirst [experiment with anecdotes](/posts/mesh-tales/01-swoosh) last week, here's\nanother one.\n\nI knew I'd need the category \"Politics\", because every now and then a topic\ncomes around that needs to be voiced. So in this category it's all about what\nour politicians do, what the voters do and what the media makes out of it.\n\n**So why do I start this today?**\n\nI come from a little rurual region in Germany, called Rhön, a place in the\nmiddle of nowhere between Bavaria (well, actually in Bavaria) and Hesse. And\nyesterday, local elections took place in both States.\n\nThe results are pretty much alarming. The right wing party AfD (Alternative for\nGermany) has gained a lot of votes in both states and has become the second\nstrongest force behind the already pretty populistic, conservative CDU/CSU\n(Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, part of the European EPP\nblock).\n\n**Now to the interpretations.**\n\nThe major topic in the election campaign was the refugee situation. It was not\nthe climate crisis. Actually nobody really talked about it. The main theme in\nthe election campaigns of CDU (mid-right), Freie Wähler (right) and AFD (too far\nright) was to bash the Green Party for their politics.\n\n**In the results, I see two trends, one encouraging and the other alarming.**\n\n- **Number one: Pro Future.** Let's say what you would need to prevent the\n  climate crisis to happen would be 100%. The Green Party did not really good in\n  that regard in the last two years. I'd assume they reached 50%. There are many\n  reasons. But it is what it is. The problem is that none of the other parties\n  reach above 20%. We are far away from saving the planet. But at least we see a\n  large stability in the Green Party's numbers despite the head wind they are\n  getting. So there is hope, there's still people (among voters and politicians)\n  who know what needs to be done.\n- **Number two: Pro Populism.** The refugee problem will not go away. And sadly\n  nobody sees that it is directly connected to the climate crisis. The Sahel\n  will be more or less inhabitable within the next 15 years. So people will\n  move. They move towards Europe. Millions of them. We are neither prepared nor\n  do we have the mindset at the moment to deal with these large numbers. So the\n  impact will be drastic. We will try to guard our borders and we will watch\n  while millions of Africans will drown in the Medierranean Sea.\\\n  Populists want to disrupt. And they will get disruption. Lots of it. Looking at\n  the next five or ten years, you can easily imagine the numbers of right wing parties\n  rise and rise while the blocks inbetween (Social Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals)\n  will be ground and crumbled by the topics they can't handle anymore. Disruption\n  will reach us and France like it did in Italy, Britain, Hungary and Poland.\n\nMuch too long post already. So I stop for now. The topic however might be worth\nanother look or two."

      "When I start imagining a new world, it's comparable to a stream of water. It's\nflowing, sometimes it hits a rock that must be softened, but most of the time,\nit's flowing automatically - through the gravity of the original idea. If it\ndoesn't flow, the idea is not good enough.\n\nLetting the water flow is the easy part for me. But just like puddles, from time\nto time ideas of stories are forming in this world, that I want to explore. Some\nof them turn out to be lakes, some are like oceans. But the small puddles are\ninteresting as well.\n\nSo I want to turn these small ideas into mini stories or anecdotes. The Mesh, my\nvirtual world cyberpunk universe is a good starting place for the first of these\nlittle pieces.\n\nI directly start with the logo. The mesh started off as a commercial project\nfrom a consortium of five huge companies and got unleashed later. But from that\ncoop - other than the old internet - it inherited an iconic logo, the swoosh.\n\nIt was the first of its kind as it marked a change in the style of logos that\nstarted off with rich, colourful brand marks and turned into reduced two\ndimensional easy to recognize but hard to identify shapes.\n\nThe swoosh was the first that dissolved its shape and additionally had built in\nanimation and motion. Additionally, you could vaguely see an \"M\" in its shape.\nThus it's the ideal representation of the mesh.\n\nToday, everyone sees this logo when starting a device that can enter the Mesh.\nIt is part of the night sky of the 3d world. and it shows up everywhere, where\nplaces in the mesh are advertised. There is even a type of QR code that is\nformed like the swoosh and indicates a Mesh location.\n\nYou can see this logo in the key visual of this storyline."

      "The visit on the moon was one of the most iconic moments in the history of\nmankind. So it's only natural, that we try to take the next step: go to another\nplanet.\n\nTherefore it's no surprise, that Mars is a very popular subject among sci-fi\nauthors and there are many novels out there,that not only choose Mars as their\nsetting, but also as a central plot device.\n\nOn the other hand, you could say that \"Mars is a Harsh Mistress\" or even \"If we\ncan make it there, we make it everywhere\". It's not the ideal destination for\nthe first steps of humanity into deep space. The gravity is way below Earth's,\nso adaptation means degradation for the Neo-Martians. They will have a hard time\nafter coming back to Earth. The atmosphere is difficult to terraform and will\nprobably never be as thick as Earth's. And the resources are sub-par compared to\nother destinations in the solar system. So people might have to live in domes\nfor a long time and wouldn't even have much to live for, except for space, of\ncourse.\n\nStill, it seems to be the only destination, we can afford at the moment. The\nonly one within reach. And I think that is what makes it attractive to writers.\nIt's realistic that we set foot on it within our lifetime.

      "This book - starting with my review quintessence - was way out of my comfort\nzone. The main theme is war. The title doesn't lie. It explains its mechanics in\nsome detail. It augments the facts we know about war with some interesting\nsci-fi twists, like aliens as a general concept. Do you feel as guilty about\nkilling aliens as you do about killing humans? And what about aliens who can be\nkilled with a single footstep. Worse? Easier?\n\nSo the sci-fi element is obviously not just for decoration, it serves a purpose.\nBut it's still a war or anti-war piece, which, as I said, is not my turf at all.\n\nThe first half is used to set the scene. I really like the way Scalzi does it. A\nbit of fun here, a lot of detail there. The author then uses the second part to\nbuild up material for a whole series, which is probably my biggest point on the\nnegative side. He doesn't really bring it to an end, which automatically makes\nit a war novel, not an anti-war novel.\n\nThis brings me back to the beginning. I don't like war or warfare. Yet it was\ninteresting to read. But the lack of a clear anti-war statement bothered me a\nlot. I probably won't read the rest of the series. Book series can never build\nup to a climax like novels or short stories. So I don't expect a different\nperspective from the other parts."

      "The climate discussion is finally leading the news headlines everywhere. This is\nactually a good thing. It starts to get into the minds of people. That's what\nthe movement needed. All of it was predicted 50 years ago already.\n\nBut now it's not only theory anymore. The news are full of real effects caused\nby the climate change. We have (now officially) the largest fires ever in\nEurope. Greece is the winner for now. We have century floods in Germany only\nsome hundred kilometers away from draught and water shortage.\n\nHow will this look like in ten years? First we have to know that nothing we do\nor start doing now will stop that direction in such a short time. So the\ndisasters will stay. They will even be bigger and more often. And the first\nareas in the world will become permnently damaged and uninhabitable.\n\nSo the impact on the society will become more direct. We will spend more money\nto repair whole damaged landscapes. And we will see governments fall apart and\n[whole nations on the move](/posts/predictions/03-climate-refugees).\n\nBut on the other hand, the topic will also wear down. Nobody will write about\ncentury floods anymore when we see one in the news every month. Remember the\nUkrainian war? It's still ongoing, but it's just not that often in the news\nanymore. The same happened with other incidents in the past. So climate\ncatastrophes will also become an everyday topic in Europe. We will get used to\nit, we will just put more effort in keeping the others who really suffer out of\nour comfortable home lands.\n\nBut at least, we finally do something against the cause and will work on our CO₂\nemissions."

      "Today's topic is neither really a trope nor an archetype, but it anyway seems\nimportant to me in this context. It's about the meaningfulness of SciFi. I think\nthere are two types of Science Fiction stories.\n\nSome use Science and imagined Science to augment a story. Think of it as an\nadventure with some added sugar in the form of - let's say - starships or\nelectronic implants. Most of these stories are projections of human stories into\na futuristic environment and make the author observe how they evolve in that\nenvironment. Most of the time, the environment is separated by the story tropes.\nYou'll find conventional heroes' journeys in space as well.\n\nThe other type seeks meaning for the reader and uses science as some sort of\ncatalyst. Think of a robot/AI that is described as a thinking and sentient\nbeing. Thoughts arrive for them just like for us humans. Now the backstory tells\nus that some of these thoughts are instructions from the interface. The robot\ncan't distinguish. Now what if it's the same for us humans? What if some of our\nthoughts are instructions from above? So the Robot is an analogy that makes a\nhuge meaning of life type problem more tangible.\n\nAstonishingly, I think that these two types don't mix up very often. There are\nrarely stories that do both. Probably because either of them needs so much\nattention."

      "As long as we can think, work has been at the centre of our existence. These\ndays, it covers around 25% of our adult life, 40 hours a week. In former times,\nit was more and it tends to become less in the next decades. Two megatrends pull\non each side of this important part of our life, on the job market place.\n\nOn the one hand, automation and AI take more and more jobs away and replace them\nwith machines. I have dedicated a whole series to that already. On the other\nhand, the generation of baby boomers (age group 1946 - 1964) will retire by 2030\nlatest when the last working boomers will be 66 years old. Thus much more people\nwill leave the job market than join. Within the next eight years, we talk about\na loss of about 4 million people. Looking at the birth rates, the trend will\ncontinue afterwards for at least five more years in similarly dramatic numbers.\n\nSo here's my prediction: Germany has a tech focus with many engineers and\nmechanics. Especially in these areas, AI will be strong in the future and we\nwill see a saturation of the market combined with an increase of productivity.\nIn many other areas like education, health care and craftsmanship, we will see a\nmassive shortage of labour that will threaten our society if we don't allow\npeople from abroad to fill the gaps through migration."

      "Superpowers in SciFi and Fantasy literature come from the wish of us humans to\nachieve more than what is theoretically possible on the one hand. On the other\nhand, they are a trait of being different and therefore they are often used as\nan analogy to unveil prejudice and envy.\n\nThe most well-known subtype connects this trope with the hero archetype and\ncreates the superhero, that everyone knows. Marvel, DC and other comics are very\nprominent examples. Especially in X-Men for instance, the topic of envy and\npersecution is popping up even among these heroic storylines.\n\nBut superpowers have more subtle appearances in many other stories as well.\nSuperpowers can be seen a generalisation of concepts like magic in fantasy\ntropes or genetic mutations in pulp sci-fi. The list is endless.\n\nWherever you look, the average person is intimidated by people with superpowers.\nTherefore these people are hiding their abilities and therefore make themselves\nmore suspicious. And all goes down the spiral. All of that can easily be\ntranslated into normal world problems of being afraid of foreigners and\nimmigrants."

      "One of the most famous SciFi authors, Arthur C. Clark, once said: \"Any\nsufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" This\ncharacterizes the novel I'd like to discuss today pretty well. Let's talk about\n\"The Fifth Season\".\n\nAs literally every SF enthusiast I know plus every blog and Booktok account\nrecommended it, I had to give it a read. \"The Fifth Season\" delivered what\neveryone promised. It is what I call a genre-bender. Is it SciFi, is it Fantasy?\nIf you're a hardcore fan of one of the two, this book might not be for you. It\nhas magical elements, but it plays in a distant future. So perhaps according to\nClarke the magic is just a sufficient advancement of the human race.\n\nN.K. (or Nora Keita) Jemisin is one of the POC, feminist writers who produce so\nmuch great output - starting with Octavia E. Butler or lately Nnedi Okorafor.\nBut with the merits of several Nebula and Hugo awards, Jemisin is not only in\ngood company but also a leading member.\n\nBack to the novel. If you like both SciFi and well-written fantasy, if dystopian\nend-time stories are your thing and engaging character development is a must,\nthen read this novel. I will surely continue with the \"Broken Earth\" series,\nwhich comes in three parts."

      "As a big cyberpunk fan, I am constantly interested in the VR topic. The\nMetaverse is the latest real-world iteration on this topic and the Apple VR\ninitiative will surely give it another spin and acceleration. So what will\nMeta's approach most likely look like in ten years?\n\nLet's go back to a valid analogy first. The internet is so successful because it\ndefines an open standard everyone can implement against. Very similar things are\nhappening on social networks with the Activity Pub and other open protocols. And\nMeta is starting an initiative to go in that direction, too.\n\nVR and AR are development- and design-heavy environments. It's web design with a\nthird dimension and therefore, it demands a heavy investment to put useful,\nconsumable information into that medium. I doubt that many players will throw\ntheir money into a closed environment like the metaverse.\n\nSo I see two possible outcomes:\n\n- The idea will open up and allow decentralised multi-platform compatible\n  solutions. In this scenario, I see many experiments running in ten years,\n  probably a first consolidation phase towards a stable open system that could\n  replace the classic internet experience.\n- The system stays closed and is maintained by Facebook alone. Then we'll have a\n  thriving space for some years and a gold rush of marketeers until the interest\n  will be in decline. Competing platforms will follow up just to decline a bit\n  later. In ten years, that new thing will not be dead yet, but you'd smell it\n  already just like you do with Facebook at the moment."

      "I'm starting with one of the most obvious tropes of all: Aliens. Other\nintelligent species are at the heart of at least half of all sci-fi and a good\nbunch of mystery stories. Aliens are fascinating for us because they represent\nboth, a threat and great opportunities.\n\nThe aliens in the stories almost never represent both. They are either enemies\nwanting to kill humanity - most of the time for the resources on our planet. Or\nthey are friendly allies.\n\nAliens are fascinating because their existence would give us the opportunity to\nextend our knowledge quickly at a speed where classic science would take\ncenturies. This is the perfect vessel for another sci-fi trope: dealing with new\nknowledge.\n\nBut the main trope aliens are used for is the mirror. Aliens mirror human\nstereotypes to the extreme, so a story can focus on them through a sociological\nmicroscope.\n\nFrom pure rational Vulcans to the Overlords in Arthur C. Clarke's \"Childhood's\nEnd\", all of them tell us something about ourselves."

      "I'm late to this sci-fi classic: Ringworld by Larry Niven. Niven has, especially\nthrough the series of the Ringworld books, become one of the most renowned and\nrespected writers of the genre, often listed as a successor of Golden Age\nauthors like Bradbury, Asimov and Clarke.\n\nUp to now, I have just read book one from the year 1970. There are eight more to\ncover. But I'm not fully drawn into it - probably not yet. I really liked the\nworldbuilding a lot, a full ring around a star. The description of the structure\nand its implications is awesome. I also liked the Pratchet'esque back stories of\nthe alien races Niven used.\n\nBut in the end, the storyline couldn't hold up. It took too long to build up and\nfelt rushed at the end. I think it also tinkered too much with the dimensions\nand distances.\n\nI will surely continue reading, the other publications happened much later -\nRingworld Engineers, the second part came out in 1980. So I hope the dynamics\nwill be a bit better and more modern."

      "Some weeks ago, I wrote an article about doctors and AI as their major job\nmarket competitors. Family Physicians mostly do one thing: diagnosing or finding\nthe correct disease based on given symptoms. Surgeons are doctors as well but\nthey do completely different tasks, they do high-precision physical work.\n\nAlthough this is the other end of the possible spectrum of work, also here AI\nand robots will take over. A machine can be infinitely more precise than a\nliving hand. Its sensors (light, infrared, distance, etc.) can be better in\norders of magnitude. Its stamina is outpacing even a large team of surgeons.\n\nThe future lies in surgeries done by machines and supervised by humans. Machines\ncan take over the whole spectrum of human health. They already surveil us\npermanently through smart watches, detect cancer earlier and most of the\ndescribed measures are already under research.\n\nDoctors won't disappear. But just like many other Jobs, their work will look\ndifferent in the future."

But there's no real killer application out there yet.\n\nAnyhow, ten years from now, this will be the single most important communication\nmethod.

Everything that is done on the phone now,\nwill be done in AR in ten years.\n\nMillions of eyeglass designs, further improvements and the first lenses will\ncontinuously improve that technology wave."

The scandals and market crashes in the past years have shown that a\nbit more regulation doesn't seem to be enough. Additionally, the capital for\ncompanies totally depends on mood. Some days ago, a fake account posted that\nInsulin is for free resulting in the near bankruptcy of the producing company.\n\nCryptocurrencies to the rescue? I don't know.

      "**Ether**, that is how they called the hypothetical medium in which light\ntravelled - until about 150 years ago. It was somehow magic because nobody had\nproof that it existed. It just lived in some mind experiments. Latest in the\nyear 1887, this haunting came to an end with the famous Michelson-Morley\nexperiment that they still teach at school.\n\nBut the term, which could be traced back to the Greek God Aither or Aithir,\nstayed alive. It became a synonym for TV transmissions and was used as the name\nof one of our most important network specifications, the Ethernet.\n\nSo fifteen years ago, when I searched for a suitable alias for all these\naccounts in the social networks, Aithir popped up at that time. This name seemed\nperfect for me. Many interpretations and connotations, so cool. One year later,\nit wore down already and that user name felt as nerdy as collecting D20 dices\n(👀).\n\nBut my alias was there to stay."
