  Childrens stories, especially adventures and the concept of the Hero's Journey
  are always connected. And Kamina is my take on a strong girl, who is always
  the hero of her story and uses her imagination to overcome challenges.

Kamina is a strong character. A girl that can achieve everything just with her
imagination. Sometimes recipes can be so simple and ideas come automatically
once the character is defined. The only challenge: She's getting older.

There are two of those stories already, both with strong fantasy elements, but
imagination can carry you in so many different worlds.

Story one therefore brings us and Kamina onto a Alice-in-Wonderland-esque
journey.

Story two was created two years later. Kamina is older now and her adventures
more mature. This time she dives into a phantastic steampunk world full of
adventures.
