The main entrance to the Mesh is the `@root` node. Although many power users
respawn in their home bases, root stays the most visited place in the mesh.
There are so many avatars showing up there at the same time, that the node is
hosted 16 times. The likelihood that you meet another avatar in root for an
appointment is not so high, you could land on any of the sixteen nodes. However,
if you step outside into the next node, everything turns normal again.

That’s why power users avoid root.

But still most of the services and big players are located in the gigantic sky
scrapers and high rises in root or on one of the neighbouring nodes. Most of the
entertainment centers, streaming stations and gambling halls are located there
with their biggest flagship stores. And the gigantic welcome & onboarding hall
is probably the single most iconic piece of virtual architecture and should be
visited at least once.
