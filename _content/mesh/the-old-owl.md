Lucy is a designer by profession and design connoisseur in her free time. Others
would say that she's an influencer because, besides her job, she maintains a
special travel blog. Not for the wonders of the real world. She's travelling the
Mesh.

Her travelling avatar is special, too. She has designed it herself from scratch,
which is very unusual these days in the Mesh, where so many things are off the
shelf. When travelling, she is a cyborg, a mix of cybernetic applications with
human body parts. Her face is almost her real one though.

In the vast depths of the mesh, you'll find a lot of famous architectural
masterpieces and 3d realms to dive into and get lost in. But today, it's finally
time to visit **Prunus Digitalis**, the tree of digital life. At first glance,
it's just a cherry tree, but it is supposed to have thousands of easter eggs to
discover. It is the go-to place for digital artists and sommeliers of good
taste. Especially today.

---

It was a four-week research challenge for Lucy to find out Mesh coordinates that
didn't want to be found. The place drew its interest from its rumors. She had to
go from forum over chat groups to bulletin boards and web pages in a long
forgotten digital style. That part was an adventure in itself.

When she finally copied the address and looked it up in the map of the Mesh, she
was astonished. It was an end-of-the-world location in the middle of nothingness
with an abundance of pure and unterraformed landscapes around.

She took the day off for the trip, plugged in and pasted the coordinates. She
arrived in an old room that looked like a shed. It was made out of wood and many
rusty tools and instruments hang on the walls. But there was a door with a heart
shaped hole in it.

After stepping out of that garage, she was a bit disappointed. There was no
tree. Just high grass till the horizon with some coloured sprinkles of flowers
in it. On the other side of the area, some 40 u away she saw another shed. It
looked like an exact copy. She walked there and saw the sign of a cicada
engraved on the door where the heart was on the other one.

She went in and suddenly found herself in a different world. The inside of that
other shed was the outside of a place somewhere else. Lucy stood on the same
grass plain. But she saw a different sky, that looked much more real than in the
usual Mesh projections. And finally, somewhere in the distance, she saw the
majestic tree rising in the middle of the green sea of grass.

She started walking. With every step, she saw more details and the tree grew
bigger and bigger. Twigs were dynamically moving on the top of the crown and the
leaves seemed to change colour creating a magical shimmer effect.

When she entered the shadowed space below the tree, still many steps away from
the trunk, she stopped for a moment and listened to the sound of the wind
blowing through the leaves.

"How can someone create such a beautiful piece of art?", she thought. It was the
most perfect Mesh diorama, she had ever seen.

Then she went on to the trunk that was as wide as a house and began to climb the
tree of life.

The tree was not hard to climb. Its bark texture was rough and she found grip
very easily. Still, it took a while and a short moment of vertigo until Lucy
reached the first branches of the crown that spanned above her like a giant
neo-gothic dome. When she found firm ground on a stable fork, she took a moment
of rest and looked around with amazement.

She checked her recording - still seeing the red dot in the corner, when she saw
something moving in the shadow on the other side of the natural plateau. Unsure
turning upward again, she even saw more things moving. The tree came to live.
Then the first clear figure appeared next to her. It was a cat. A big one.
Streamlined, desert coloured with black tipped ears. Just like her own Cybergirl
avatar, the cat, the Caracal, had bionic metal parts on its body. Beautifully
crafted artwork.

![digital caracal jumps down](tat-07)

Was she in danger? Was she under attack? That was her second thought while she
brought tension and readiness into her resting body again.

Lucy didn't dare to move. She was amazed by the art around her and by the
caracal itself, the most beautiful creature she had ever seen inside the digital
world. But she also was paralyzed and afraid. Would it attack her? Was this some
kind of shooter game where she came unarmed?

But the cat moved on. Strode past her with a proud look in its eyes and gave her
a slight touch along the way. After some deep breaths, she continued her climb.

About one storey away, she caught a glimpse beyond the leaves of the tree into
the sky. It slowly turned into a dark grey and it began to rain slightly. Then
she noticed that also the leaves themselves had shifted colours. The season was
changing. It was autumn now, but that was no reason to give up.

At the time when it started to snow big, chunky snowflakes, she saw another
iconic creature. It was a raven shimmering in black and violet. That bird also
had cyber applications and mechanical parts. It even wore metal eyeglasses that
seemed to come right out of a steampunk movie.

And it started to talk.

![raven with steampunk mask comes out of the fog](tat-08)

"A warm welcome, Lucy", started the raven. The bird which was quite large even
for a raven looked into a gigantic book clad in leather with golden
applications. The front emblem showed a drawing of an insect, a cicada. Again
that cicada sign that she spotted in every detail on this tree.

"Today is a special day, you know that right?", it continued in a lecturing
voice. "It's the day of the owl and you are the first who has come so far this
season. But first, I will invite you to my house".

The dark-feathered guy with cybernetic applications on its back made a gesture
with a wing and Lucy followed. Several trunks, branches, natural ladders and
climbs later, she saw the house.

![tree house with a cicada door](tat-09)

It was even more beautiful than the rest of the scene, naturally, organically
fitting into the tree's structure and with stunning architecture in a style that
ranged from naturalistic to Art Deco.

The front door was formed exactly like the logo on the book. It was the cicada
again. It reminded here to take some additional notes for later research and
back story creation. Where did she see the logo again? It was definiely on the
entrance door of the second shed, the trunk, the raven's book and even the
battery pack of the caracal.

She entered and had a cup of tea with the bird that seemed so human in its
gestures.

The tree and the area were constantly changing. Lucy particularly noticed that
when she stepped outside the raven's tree house again. It was dark although only
some minutes had passed. The tree was lit by some Japanese lanterns and
thousands of small lights that presumably came from all those sleeping
semi-cyborg semi-insectoid inhabitants - yet another iconic photo she would have
to take.

The black bird showed her the way as they climbed even further to the top of the
crown. Finally, she had reached a plateau at the top and could have a look
beyond the roof of leaves.

![old barn owl wathces you](tat-10)

"Hello, Lucy", another darker and calmer voice said. A huge barn owl sat next to
her, the large moon in its back. "You are this year's winner. Is it what you
expected".

"Oh, it's so much more", she said. "I had to take a photo every five seconds."

"Mmh. I might have a surprise for you", was the old owl's answer.

Then the dawn broke, the night ended. Suddenly all the leaves fell, millions of
cherry blossom buds opened and turned the tree into a pink miracle.

---

For the work on her virtual travel blog, Lucy was well-equipped for excursions
like that. She had set up two virtual cameras constantly following her and
taking videos of the scene. Also, she usually took additional eye shots and
hi-res stills to be able to go into details.

But as she looked at her media library the next day, nothing was in there. There
was no proof that she even was at that magic place. Nothing she could use,
except her memories. Even the coordinates were wiped out of the system's
history.

But wait. She found one file from the previous day. Its name:
`prunus-digitalis.tgz`. She unpacked it and found one text document and an
executable. She opened the file. There was only one sentence:

"For your eyes only".

Then she dared to activate the executable. She found herself back in the tree.
She could go forward and backwards in time and watch herself explore the digital
wonder from every angle. But she never managed to copy any content out of it.
