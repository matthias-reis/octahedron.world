title: The Mesh
description: >-
  My favourite genre: Cyberpunk. William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and the visual
  appeal of Blade Runner are my prototypical vision of the future. And we still
  seem to be on the way there, no doubt. So I had to create my own version of it
  and started with some sketches already when I was fifteen or so.

The Mesh itself is a 3D world, like the Metaverse. I developed it a long time
ago, probably ata bout the same time when I read genre classics like Neuromancer
and Snow Crash.

At that time I was convinced that a threedimensional internet will exist one
day. I didn't think that it would be as crappy and niche as it is today. Or have
you ever missed being in the Metaverse? Hav you ever been there? Does your
internet consumption also consist of vide doomscrolling instead of vivd
adventures?

Yep, thought so. But in the nineties, the Mesh was an adventurous place in my
head.

But nuff said. You have to read up the world building first.

There's also a full short story already. It's inspired by a project that I once
read about. The most famous bridge in Hamburg could become a hotel one day.

Thinking it to the end, that project would fail and it's remains would get
occupied by cyberpunk creatures.

A second one followed, although it's more of a draft, a sketch or let's say a
mood board for what is possible in the mesh. Actually it's the story behind the
tattoos on my left arm.

Additionally, I have produced some flash fiction episodes to get into the mood.
