title: The Mesh
description: >-
  My favourite genre: Cyberpunk. William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and the visual
  appeal of Blade Runner are my prototypical vision of the future. And we still
  seem to be on the way there, no doubt. So I had to create my own version of it
  and started with some sketches already when I was fifteen or so.
