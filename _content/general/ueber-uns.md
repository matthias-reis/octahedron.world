# Who am I?

Hi, my name is Matthias.

I am a Software Engineer and Team Lead. But since I was a teenager, I have been
thinking of stories and building other worlds in my head. Later, I have written
them down, forgot them, found them again, added layers of ideas to them and so
on.

I am several decades older and still, from time to time, I have ideas popping
up. So there's plenty of material.

# What should I do with all that content in my head?

Some years ago, one of these ideas grew so large that it had to be channelled
into a novel. And I have even managed to write and publish it together with my
beloved wife, Anne. It is a fantasy novel written in German and called "Die
Hermetiker". And I'm sure I will place one or the other hint on these pages,
probably even a sample chapter. For the beginning, you can read about its
worldbuilding and other things

==> hermetics

But there were many other stories ranging from space opera over cyberpunk to
researched science facts. For those, I haven't found a suitable channel yet.

I've tried many formats. As a developer, it's so easy to get lost in creating
the best possible blog technology and forgetting about the content. And so I've
tried many variants all bound to conditions like "at least one complete article
per week". And I never managed to deliver that much and lost track after a
while.

## Byte Sized Fiction

Then came the Twitter crisis. Elon Musk wanted to buy Twitter. And everyone
tried out other things like [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@aithir). This was
the opportunity for a reboot and the creation of a purposeful account.

The format was given. The maximum on that instance was 1.000 characters per
toot. So I sliced my content into small 150-word-pieces and published the
material in series that I called [storylines](/storylines). What started was a
phase I called the Cambrian Explosion of content.

Because you might lose the overview after some time when skimming throug a
social media feed, after a while I came back to the original plan of creating a
website for it. But this time with the difference that there is quite some
content already.

And the routined pace of **four contributions per week** or 2 to 3 printed pages
remained. Amazing. And I'll never forget the additional thrill beyond continuous
writing: compression into flash fiction and and creating a little bit of
suspense every day.

# Reformatting

But that was not the end. Sooner or later, the concept had to reach its creative
limits and the willingnes to go beyond this artificial constraint got bigger and
bigger. The next iterations therefore went back to publishing full short
stories, this time in a monthly magazine format. I also refurbished the
Storylines and recreated full fledged short stories out of them again. But you
could still see how things grew. All content is live during their creation with
all the steps inbetween. Whenever a new chapter or paragraph will be available,
the site will be updated.

# Consolidating

Fast forward to 2026. Another big change of the page and especially its content.
I've dropped the concept of monthly magazines with mixed topics and introduced a
structure that leans into my story arcs. One chapter for each arc and you find
all the material that belongs to one world in that chapter, ready to explore the
whole world at once.

Creating fiction in the area of sci fi and fantasy means worldbuilding. Creating
Principles that can be reused is much simpler and more concise than starting
with a story and trying to adapt the surroundings to it. This is my way of
imagining content and I thought this should be reflected on the page.

Side effect: All of my other ideas (music, games, coding, photography) fit in as
well.

## Nitty Gritty

Want some tech facts about the portal?

I'm using **Solid JS** (Solid Start) and deploy everything to a self hosted
Docker Image that lives in a self hosted **Hetzner** server. Therefore I turned
away from my previous iterations with Next.js and Vercel (whose policies I don't
like that much anymore).

I don't want ads on the platform. The minimal and bespoke tracking is done via -
you guessed it - a self hosted Matomo instance (after also exiting Google
Analytics).

I use Tailwind for the styles and a bespoke markdown pipeline base on unified
and remark to create the pages. All the text lives next to the code and goes
through the same deployment cycle as the code itself.

Every topic comes with its signature image. Most of the key visual images come
from the **midjourney** AI or Gemini's Nano Banana.

## Have Fun

**The first purpose of my texts is to entertain myself during writing.**

But I also appreciate feedback and discussion. How do you like it? Would you
want something changed? Are you curious about what is coming next?

I'm still thinking of a direct feedback loop inside the page. I'd love to hear
your thoughts. But for now, you can [mail me](mailto:mr@octahedron.world), or
reach me via [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@aithir),
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/octahedron.bsky.social) or
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matzn/).

But of course, I also want you to have some fun with my texts.
