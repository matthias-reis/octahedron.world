  My take on the fantasy genre. We are in a classical magic theme and move
  between the sub-genres of dark academia and urban fantasy. The story focuses
  on secret societies of magicians in a modern world setting.

My wifes and my biggest writing endeavour was our novel "Die Hermetiker". Around
2015 I started off with planning a complete world. I knew I wanted to do
something with magic, something for grown-ups, so no Harry Potter stuff, but
extracting some of the essence from there. The universe grew in my head and I
started sketching out its details.

You can look into those drafts here in the following article to start immersing
into this world just like I did at that time:

```yaml teaser
slug: hermetics-worldbuilding
```

After that, we started drafting, then we were crafting chapter by chapter,
revising while working on the next chapters. Re-reading, re-writing, polishing.
It took us years to get to a final version we were happy with.

But what would be a book creation experience without the whole story? So I sat
down and fired up In-Design for the layout and then Procreate for the hand drawn
cover art. Then brought everything together aund shipped it through a self
publishing house.

**And did I mention the landing web page, where you can buy your own physical
copy?**

```yaml cta
url: https://amreis.de/
text: Visit amreis.de
```

After having such a fantasy world in your head, ideas might spin automatically.
That was especially the case with our urban fantasy setup, where our real world
is mingling with the magical elements.

Here's another full blown short story set in the same universe:

Finally, here are some further thought and deep dives. This area might grow over
time

```yaml group
slugs:
  - puppets
  - academy
```

Hope you enjoyed the ride. Don't forget to buy the book! ;)
