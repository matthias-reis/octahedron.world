It appeared on every news channel in the morning. The ships were ready—an
exciting moment for the colony, which had been working toward this event since
its founding, now 823 years ago.

Fourteen-year-old Mijk was sitting at breakfast when the news about the ships
appeared on his lenses. He often woke up early, so he could get into the
bathroom and to the food modeller before his three sisters. In their large
household, meals were often cooked manually. His mother Magret and a few others
in their shared living group had developed a passion for cooking. So the
modeller was rarely used for lunches and dinners—if at all then mainly to
produce certain ingredients. In the mornings though, for breakfast, everyone
used it.

Mijk listened attentively to the report and afterwards opened the stream of
additional information. He was utterly fascinated by the spaceship project. For
as long as he could remember, progress on its construction had been a constant
topic in the news. But he had every bit of additional information stored in his
mind—from the planned blueprints and the navigation methods on the bridge, all
the way to the propulsion technology—he absorbed everything.

Cleary delighted, he ate his muesli while his sisters gradually trickled in.
Gena, who was only a year older than him, was the last to climb out of her bunk.
She was a late riser. His two other sisters were already twenty—twins, who
always had their heads together wherever they went. Mijk found them somewhat
exhausting.

“Time to go!” his mother shouted from the next room, then burst through the
door. School was waiting.

Mijk and Gena set off. They passed through five corridors and four sections
until they reached their school. Most days, like today, they took the
commuters—small, self-driving platforms they could stand on. In the station's
intelligent routing system, the platforms handled every request of their
passengers autonomously. That way the school run took only a few minutes; on
foot they sometimes needed half an hour.

Every other day, they could attend lessons from home anyway. The colony simply
didn’t have enough physical room for all students. Mijk, who was a model
student, didn’t understand why his mother and the others in their commune
thought live attendance was so important. Most of the time he understood
everything immediately and never needed to ask questions that required a teacher
to be in the same room.

But today, they wanted to be at school as early as possible. The ships were the
number one topic before class. Everyone was talking about them. Mijk—the grand
expert—knew the most and was practically squeezed dry for information by the
others.

“Please make your way to the large assembly room,” a voice echoed through the
corridors. It was an announcement broadcast from Professor Greger, the current
principal. “The first lesson is cancelled today. I have something important to
tell you.”

Normally, all information appeared as short messages on their lenses. Mijk
couldn’t recall _ever_ having heard a spoken announcement from those
loudspeakers. Many didn’t even know what the grated ceiling fixtures were for at
all. After the announcement, several seconds of uneasy silence followed. Then
the murmuring returned—and grew even louder. It only stopped when an alert
appeared on their lenses, telling them that lessons were about to begin.

“823 years,” Greger began solemnly. “Exactly 823 years ago today, the settlers
of the third wave—our ancestors—arrived here in this system. Only 12,000 people
made it here back then.”

Mijk was already bored. Greger was starting far too far in the past. That he
went all the way to the beginning was too much. He might as well have started
with the first preparations for the first wave. They had already covered all of
that dozens of times in lessons.

“In the meantime,” Greger continued, “there are now over 2.3 million of us in
the Procyon system. Here on Racoon alone, in your neighbourhood, 800,000 people
are currently living. But no one back then could have foreseen that. Our
predecessors had to endure many hardships. They found no habitable planet around
our star and instead selected two small sheltered regions on the most suitable
chunks of rock they could find, and began building everything up from scratch.

Today—you have surely already seen the news yourselves—it is time for a new
mission that, just like back then, leads into the unknown. Our Polis has
therefore requested that the following must be delivered verbally to every
student. Myself and your other teachers are of course available for any
questions you may have.”

Again, a wave of murmuring broke out, which the principal silenced with a simple
gesture.

“The Polis of Racoon and Loton,” Greger read, “have unanimously decided that our
shared mission should enter its next phase. The ships are ready. It is now time
to plan the new objectives in detail and—just like our ancestors—to select
15,000 pioneers who will set forth into a new world.

Exactly six years from today, the two ships will launch and travel through space
for a long time, until their passengers become the first to set foot on new
soil.

In order to give this pioneer generation the best possible starting conditions
after a long journey, it is necessary to select people as young as possible and
prepare them perfectly for this extraordinary situation.

On the ship, places will primarily be reserved for the current generation of 12-
to 18-year-olds.

Whether you, dear students, will be among them—you will find out later today. We
will soon be sending invitations to 10,000 young people.”

Mijk knew the mission almost by heart. He also knew they were recruiting younger
people, but he didn’t think _his_ age group would be involved. Then came
numbers—and numbers were his favourite toy.

Ten thousand adolescents. That meant roughly one in ten in his age group. The
ships could each hold 8,000 people without trouble. So for 5,000 pioneers there
was more than enough free space—but of course several thousand specialists were
needed to complete the journey and continue educating the youth.

They spent the whole day on the schoolyard speculating about every aspect of it.
After the announcement, there was no chance of normal lessons resuming.

---

In the evening, the whole house sat down for dinner. In their home, alongside
his relatives, lived two other women and two men around his mother’s age with
their children. The older generations were also part of this multi-generational
household, as had been customary on Racoon for centuries. Today, no fewer than
fourteen people were seated around the table.

Suddenly, in the middle of the meal, a message appeared on his lens. Almost at
the same time, he and his sister Gena jumped up from their chairs and let out a
shout of joy.

“I’m in!” they yelled, loud enough that Henka, Mijk’s grandmother, almost
choked. Unluckily, she was sitting right between the two.

After that, they had to report in detail to everyone at the table. They had
already told their mother shortly after school, and some reports had already
come in via the lenses. Still, everyone wanted to know exactly what was going
on.

“It says here,” began Mijk, “that starting next week we’ll be allowed to attend
a different school. We'll still be able to learn a lot of things from home, but
we will have direct personal contacts for everything—teachers and trainers who
are there just for us. If we want, it says.” He snorted. “What kind of question
is that? Of course we want to, right, Gena?”

Even though families were large and the individual bonds somewhat looser than
they used to be on old Earth, you could still clearly see the disappointment on
Magret’s face, Mijk’s mother. She would lose both children. It would still take
six years, but then they would be gone.

“Hello, Mijk,” said the man through the lenses about half an hour after dinner,
“I’m Gowen, your instructor.”

“Good day,” replied Mijk, not quite understanding.

“Each of the ten thousand has been assigned a personal instructor,” the man
continued. He was tall, dark-skinned. He looked almost _too_ perfect. It was
nearly impossible to estimate his age.

“No, no,” Gowen seemed to read Mijk’s thoughts. “I’m not a Neuro, people have
said that to me a lot. I’m used to it. No—I’m a normal human being, and I’ll be
at your place in about five minutes. I want to show you something.”

---

Mijk had stood here once before—at the place where the third wave landed, here
on Loton. But this time, Gowen told him a slightly different version of the
story.

The first wave went back to an idea conceived by a man named Marc van der
Venden, the President of the United Nations, in the 23rd century of Earth-time.
It was the first program that would extend beyond the lifetime of his own
generation—remarkable. After all, its final goal would only be reached after
500,000 human generations. But at that time, just as in Mijk’s time, almost
nobody truly believed in it.

It was about breaking out into the Milky Way—exploring and settling every single
potentially livable planet. He planned all of this over many years together with
a team of physicists, engineers, sociologists, and political scientists — using
comprehensive but simple and realistic methods. If new technology sped up the
mission, all the better. If obstacles arose—personal or catastrophic—that
hindered the project, then at least they had tried.

And so they built their first generation-ship. The resources and conditions were
not always stable, and so it took them 700 years to complete—300 less than van
der Venden had allotted for each wave.

The first ship set off toward Alpha Centauri as the Solar system already had
five human colonies. In addition to Earth, humans had settled Mars, the Moon,
Titan, and the eternal ice of Jupiter’s moon Europa.

After another 1,200 years, the second wave succeeded, while Earth itself had
already conquered another planetary system. In the centuries that followed, the
colonies were just as active as the people here at Procyon. Only around 60 years
ago came the announcement through the space-channels that the 14th star had been
successfully colonized.

By now, the diameter of the human sphere of influence reached almost 20
light-years. All colonies constantly exchanged data, though physics remained
unchanged — it still took 20 years for important information to reach the other
systems.

Since Procyon lies about 12 light-years from Earth, the information received by
the residents of Racoon and Loton lagged accordingly far behind. “In some areas
on old Earth,” Gowen chuckled as he explained it to Mijk, “even today it takes
longer for progress to arrive.”

“But we ourselves here on Racoon,” Gowen continued proudly, “have made our own
technical achievements and discoveries which other colonies have adopted from
us. Our modellers can autonomously build livable structures in the shortest time
at any gravitational level—even in zero-gravity.

Since we have no planet with atmosphere here, unlike most others, we had to
specialize in domes, platforms, corridors, digging into rock, and developing
powerful protective shields against meteor-showers.”

Racoon, like Loton, is not very large and its gravity is rather weak. Mijk
weighs only half as much here as he would on old Earth. And later during the
acceleration phase of the flight, the same gravitational forces of 1g exist.
That is why all pioneers had to constantly train to build up their muscles.

“Even though by now we possess every conceivable kind of technology to survive
even under the most hostile conditions,” Gowen lectured further, “it doesn’t
mean that life there will be easy. In the star systems where habitable planets
with atmospheres were found, live now twenty times as many people as in
artificial habitats.”

It was a joy talking with Gowen. For Mijk it never felt like schooling. He
absorbed everything technical—and also the social and cultural topics fascinated
him deeply: how would people live together, what form of government would make
sense…

Sometimes he and his sister Gena combined their lessons. Whenever they did, he
noticed that each of the 10,000 pioneers received a customized curriculum
perfectly aligned with their interests and needs.

Long before the ships were even completed, many experts had debated which would
be the ideal star. What would be the destination of the journey? Which planetary
system should humanity conquer next?

“The choice was actually easy,” Gowen began his description of their future
home. “Luyten’s Star isn’t as strong or as large as Procyon — in fact, it’s a
red dwarf, one of the smallest classes of stars that exist. But in return, the
system is pleasantly calm. The star is stable, emits few eruptions, and casts a
warm light.

And it is only 1.2 light-years away. That means your journey will be much
shorter than that of the pioneers who arrived here 800 years ago. You’ll be
travelling only twelve years.”

“Luyten’s Star even has planets with an atmosphere,” Mijk replied eagerly.

“Yes, Mijk. The probability is high that someday you will be able to get rid of
glass-domes and walk openly upon the planetary surface. Certainly not your
generation of pioneers — but your children or grandchildren. They will have it
comfortable.”

---

The year of the launch of the two generation-ships was something special for the
Procyonites. Many festivals and celebrations were interspersed between the
numerous preparations and training sessions to attune them to the great journey
ahead.

More and more frequently, Mijk and Gena were out in space. In small gliders they
were brought to the spaceport, from where they conducted reconnaissance flights
within Procyon’s solar system and its slightly dimmer companion star. They
primarily had to prepare for life conditions during the long journey, but also
learned how to plan and build new habitats on suitable rocky planets.

Now there were only twelve days left until departure. It was Mijk’s nineteenth
birthday. What a coincidence: for today, his moving into the ship was scheduled.
Every pioneer was assigned a different date, so that there wouldn’t be too much
traffic and logistical chaos around the spaceport and within the ship.

For Mijk, the organizers made an exception—and allowed the entire family to come
aboard for the day. The whole commune had been planning a combined
farewell-and-birthday celebration for several days already. It became a
warm-hearted evening. But, however, it had to end in a farewell forever. Mijk
did not find that nearly as distressing as his mother did—or, more surprisingly,
as his two older sisters seemed to.

After all, they would remain in direct communication for a long time—even later
still, though with a year’s delay. For Mijk, it was time anyway to detach from
his family and stand on his own feet. He had been prepared for that for the last
six years.

Furthermore, it didn’t feel like a farewell to Mijk at all. They invited their
new neighbours—the residents of the adjacent habitats on the ship. Some he
already knew from training; others he met for the first time that evening. Of
course, as birthday child and centre of attention, he was introduced quickly to
everyone. At times, the attention almost became too much for him—with a note of
nervousness for launch day mixed in.

The next day, when all the guests had been flown back to Racoon, he was glad to
have a few minutes on his own in his habitat to enjoy the silence.

“You and your new colony,” Gowen began his last lesson. “Yes—it will be _your_
colony, Mijk. You will be one of the founding fathers, and I envy you for that.
But I’m at least glad to have contributed a small part.”

“Gowen,” replied Mijk, “you’ve taught me everything I need to know. You have an
extraordinary share in all of this. And now you’ll surely be appointed to work
on the next generation of ships. You’re one of the most important Procyonites,
if you ask me. And a good friend.”

“I’m touched,” Gowen answered. “But what I truly want to tell you is this. You
and your colony—you will have a vital influence on how it will function, on what
happens in your first thousand years, whether you survive everything, and how
resilient you will be. You know the history of Sirius — the failed mission that
tore itself apart in brutal war.

If I could make one wish, it would be that you create a peaceful, prosperous
world—one into which my grandchildren and great-grandchildren may one day follow
you.

Van der Venden, who planted the idea of conquering the Milky Way into humanity’s
mind over 2,800 years ago, did so in the only right way—by ensuring that wars,
dictatorships, and the hunger for power would not destroy it.

Today there are fourteen star colonies of humanity. No dictator or tyrant can
seize all power over all humans anymore. The distances are too great—which
significantly increases the probability that humanity will survive its crises.

No matter how hostile the conditions may be—or conversely, how beautiful and
livable your world might become—there is only one great goal: Hold to it and
build a ship with which _you_ will send pioneers on the next journey to discover
the next world. You are the fourth wave—but there must be 500,000 more to fulfil
the entire mission.”

The day of the launch arrived. Mijk was extremely excited, although he actually
had absolutely nothing to do except check his special seat in the launch chamber
about twelve more times, the sat which made the strong g-forces of liftoff
somewhat more tolerable.

Gena had the seat right next to him, but she didn’t show up until around noon.
She somehow had the nerves to fall asleep even on this day—calm until the very
last moment. Enviable, thought Mijk.

Getting 10,000 adolescents aligned and unified under a single mission had been a
massive undertaking. And of course, participation was voluntary. Over the past
six years, more than 3,000 pioneers had dropped out or been deselected. They
attempted to compensate through additional nominations. On top of that came more
than 4,000 specialists—from professors to navigators to entertainers—who were
indispensable for the flight and for the later development of the new society.
But most of all, the pioneers benefited from the Neuros—the artificial
intelligences that controlled nearly all of the highly complex systems for
flight, life support, and service.

In the end, the generation-ships had 12,880 passengers. And all of
them—including the pilots—sat strapped into their g-seats 20 minutes before
launch. The seats regulated blood pressure and oxygen supply. Everyone was
waiting. The Neuros were working at full capacity on the final launch
preparations.

---

Being connected to the monitoring systems was something Mijk had gotten used to.
During the last year they had performed a total of eight test flights, reaching
each time the maximum acceleration of 8 R—eight times his body-weight on Racoon.
Over 400 kg pressed onto the body in those moments. Now he would face that
again. The main difference this time was the duration. With two short breaks
every four hours, they would have to endure this strain for the next twelve
hours.

At first, however, they would transition through a phase of weightlessness. The
rotors that generated gravity were switched off now. He noticed how he became
steadily lighter. A queasy feeling in his stomach announced it.

“One minute until disengagement,” the Neuro reported over the speakers. They had
to remove their lenses for the launch phase. Announcements and external monitors
were now their only means of communication.

Then the main boosters fired and caused vibrations all across the ship. At the
same time—now entirely weightless—Mijk felt a jolt accompanied by a tremoring
roar. They were detached from the docks. The journey had begun.

Seconds later, the maneuvering thrusters fired and pushed a portion of gravity
back into his body. His stomach reacted to each change and rewarded him with a
wave of mild nausea.

The ship drifted several hundred meters away from the spaceport into the void.
They watched on the monitors as the station grew slowly smaller.

After five long minutes during which both of the gigantic ships aligned
themselves properly the enormous boosters ignited and the pioneers were pressed
into their g-seats as if a giant block of concrete were thrown onto them.

The _Ebbighausen_—Mijk’s ship—shot out of their home system parallel to the
_Luyten_, its sister-ship. The first acceleration phase was crucial because it
allowed the combination of all three propulsion systems to be used to reach
their travel speed of ten percent of the speed of light: solar wind, laser
sails, and finally the powerful ion-booster.

Only when Mijk paid very close attention, and forced himself through the gravity
to adjust the external camera-feed on the monitor, he could make out the massive
sails that stretched like an umbrella over the long habitat-cylinders.

---

T plus 12 hours.

“We did it!” shouted Gena first, somewhere in the section beside him. “The
boosters are turning down!”

Second by second, they felt more and more weight lifting off their shoulders.
From now on they had to adapt to what was left—the constant travel acceleration,
which was twice that of Racoon’s gravity. That adjustment would take time. Mijk
remembered that during the journey they would experience roughly the same forces
as on old Earth, if Gowen was correct. It must have been exhausting to live
there, he thought.

Nevertheless, they could now unbuckle and move around normally. At first a bit
clumsy and heavy-legged, they quickly adapted throughout the next weeks.

After the first day they had reached a travel speed of 1,200 km/s. From now on
they would add around 500 km/s each day until they reached their cruising
velocity of about 30,000 km/s.

---

Six months under heightened gravity — Mijk had gotten used to it quickly and
built up muscle accordingly. Still, he sometimes longed for a bit less
resistance with every movement.

Today was the day. They had reached their travel speed and from now on would
move without further propulsion. The boosters were shut down. For a short time
they were weightless again until the cylinders’ rotors started up and once more
settled the pioneers into their accustomed Racoon-gravity.

It was a joy to float weightlessly through the corridors. But once gravity
returned, everyday life began. At least there were some areas within the
interior of the cylinders where zero-gravity prevailed.

Together with forty other pioneers, Mijk was being trained to become an
architect. Architects were not primarily responsible for designing and
constructing buildings, that was merely a side aspect. Rather, this team was
responsible for the settlement and terraforming strategies of their new
homeworld—one of the most critical tasks, architecting their future. Numerous
other specialists would support them in determining suitable settlement sites,
making planets habitable, or constructing habitats in underground caverns.

Gena, ever sociable, had already befriended some of their neighbours and her own
work group, and had to pull Mijk along a little — he had always been more of a
loner back on Racoon and rarely went out. But the ship offered plenty of
variety. Very close to their habitat-area there was a pub, and it soon became
tradition to go there once or twice a week and meet up with the others.

Some earlier lessons on Racoon had also dealt with social life. A new society
was to be built with only 10,000 people, genetic diversity had to be ensured
early on. It had been the same on Racoon already, but for this small group it
was even more critical. Each female pioneer was therefore ideally supposed to
have as many children as possible with different men. That naturally affected
social structures. Families would grow larger, family membership and composition
would change faster, and bonds would be more fluid.

Gena embraced this early. She fell in love with one of her colleagues in the
ship’s biological laboratories and became pregnant. Six years after launch,
roughly halfway through their journey, Mijk became an uncle. Elika, his little
niece, was by far not the first baby born aboard the _Ebbighausen_. There were
already over one hundred young spacefarers.

Mijk initially rather focused on his work. After ten years of travel, the
astronomers could deliver the first detailed data of Luyten’s Star and its
planets. They could determine their statistical numbers, which moons had
suitable sizes, and what atmospheres existed. Valuable information, because this
enabled simulations that allowed them to preselect a suitable landing and
settlement site even before they could see the system with their own eyes.

Later, Mijk also formed bonds while becoming a valuable crew member. Arin, his
girlfriend, was his age and, like Gena, worked in the biological division. She
tended the arboretums that regulated oxygen levels within the habitats.

“You’re always so absorbed in your work,” Arin said one evening.

“There’s so much to prepare before we land,” Mijk replied.

“Come on, I’ll show you something,” she answered simply. Mijk was puzzled — and
curious.

They walked down a corridor. Two habitat-zones away was a large biological
laboratory.

“Up here,” Arin pointed to a small freight elevator that led toward the ship’s
center.

They rode up—the lift disengaged—and suddenly weightlessness set in. Through the
ceiling they could see a vast, dim hall as the lift doors opened. Mijk felt a
flutter in his stomach.

“Those are my trees,” Arin finally said. “Come on—push off with me.” They
drifted toward the treetops. Arin was skilled at navigating in zero gravity and
eventually Mijk began to enjoy it too.

“Lights off,” Arin instructed the Neuro after some time, having examined the
buds of the trees. “It will start in a moment,” she said to Mijk.

It was completely dark at first, but after a few seconds Mijk noticed a pale
glow that became stronger and stronger. Filament-like, the milky light drifted
through the air.

“The spores,” Arin explained, “we make them glow so we can control the process
better. I think it’s beautiful.”

“How long does the effect last?” Mijk asked.

“About an hour,” she said. “Then we draw the spores back in.”

Mijk pulled Arin close. “Then we have an hour,” he said.

---

During the journey, the crew could send messages home at any time. But as the
flight went on, the response time grew longer and longer. By now, a transmission
took over a year. Information from the other colonies also constantly arrived,
reports of new discoveries, political developments, or catastrophes. The largest
stream of data still came from Earth.

Their own mission, however, proceeded like a textbook example. First, the ships
had been finished much earlier than planned in the Procyon system. After twelve
years of travel without major incidents, they finally arrived in the system of
Luyten’s Star. Mijk and Arin had been relocated shortly before arrival to one of
the accompanying reconnaissance ships and could take a look at the solar system
earlier than the others. They found a total of six rocky planets with suitable
gravity, three of them in the habitable zone. One of these even had an
oxygen-bearing atmosphere. It would still take several generations until it was
directly habitable—nevertheless, compared to other missions and to their old
home on Racoon, one might already call it a paradise.

During the voyage, 10 of the 12,880 people had died, while many of the young
families were already contributing urgently needed offspring. They arrived with
more passengers than they had departed with.

Mijk had been appointed to the Great Council, the body responsible for making
decisions during the transition period. Naturally, they chose Luyten 3, the
planet with the oxygen-rich air, as their new home planet .

“Welding will be difficult,” began Klas, an engineer from Mijk’s team. “The
oxygen concentration is very high.”

“True,” Mijk confirmed. “At first we should only let Neuros and modellers onto
the planet. They can assemble the habitats. We’ll move the manufacturing to the
moon. There are enormous metal resources for construction, as well as stone for
glass production. We should possibly use the main reactor from one of the ships
at first, so that we don’t have to build another energy source.”

“But what are people supposed to do in the meantime?” asked Iossi, another
colleague.

“Everyone stays on their ship for a little longer,” Klas said. “We expected
this. The solar panels provide sufficient energy for life support. Some
auxiliary systems would need to be shut down.”

“You’re saying nobody should go down at first?” countered Arin, Mijk’s
girlfriend, who also took part in the planning. “But we need to start the
breeding and planting projects as soon as possible. We need breathable air.”

With visibly pregnant belly she sat in the auditorium of the scout ship and
presented the plans of the biological team. Much of the work would again be
handled by the Neuros. But their task would now need to invert completely:
instead of oxygen-producing plants — like on the ships and the habitats of
Procyon — organisms had to be used that _consumed_ oxygen, filtered toxins,
produced greenhouse gases in the required quantities, and thus created a viable
atmosphere. But for this process, supervision was unavoidable. “One must feel
it,” she said.

In the end, they opted for a small outpost and a mobile accommodation—a large,
flying caravan, so to speak—into which Mijk and Arin moved, along with four
other scientists.

Anno 840 in Procyon-time became year 1 in Luyten-time.

Three months after arrival, Nika was born. Mijk and Arin’s daughter was
officially the first Luytener.

Although the Neuros ensured perfect care of the heavily pregnant Arin and
monitored the birth flawlessly, complications arose. Arin died only a few days
after Nika’s birth.

For a short while, Mijk collapsed and fell into deep depressions. After that he
quickly lost himself in his work and caring for Nika, which left him no idle
time.

“We have great fortune,” he said at the funeral, seemingly moved. “Our new home,
rough as it may seem, is the perfect place for a new beginning. Everything here
is emerging. But we must also make great sacrifices. And we should never forget
that.”

About a year later the habitats were ready, and the pioneers could move in
gradually. Mijk and Nika traded their temporary residence—the “campervan,” as
they called it—for a permanent home and moved in with Mijk’s sister Gena, his
niece Elika (now seven years old), and several others into a shared commune in
the city they named Ebbig—named after their ship, which in turn had been named
after Ebbighausen, one of the discoverers of the star system.

In total, the council had planned eight medium-sized habitats distributed across
the large main continent — four of them situated by the water. Rapid
communication lines and permanent transport systems connected the settlements.

Life in their new home had begun. Initially rough and unfamiliar — but with the
potential for paradise.

---

They speak of waves—but nobody I’ve asked still knows what that word even means.

In any case, today is a historic day. Today we arrived in the Rahl star system
and landed on its fourth planet. Officially, this completes the 5000th wave.

Information streams in constantly from thousands of star systems. All of it has
been sent out at different times. Our machines filter it for us and produce what
they claim to be an objective history of the Milky Way. I don’t trust the
machines very much anymore—not since we intercepted some of the transmissions
ourselves with our own radio phalanxes.

I believe some of the other colonies are already controlled by machines. We
should build machines whose only task is to supervise the other machines—let
them fight among themselves. Sadly, we cannot manage without them, because the
clock is ticking. We have a colony to awaken and another ship to build.

They also speak of the old Earth, the planet where it all began. They say it was
destroyed a million years ago. Yet many here on the ship and in the incoming
reports still speak of Earth as if it were a sacred place. Our star maps still
record the Solar system. From here it lies 12,500 light-years away and seems to
belong to the territory of an alliance that calls itself Luytena. But how can
one trust information that is over 10,000 years old?

I suppose we should still be grateful that we have a node in the information
network of the galaxy. Almost one quarter of the Milky Way is now inhabited by
descendants of Earth — or by their machines. Surely there are regions by now
where all memory of that origin has been lost entirely. Or—perhaps—those people
are better off?

They speak of aliens and still call them extraterrestrials, as if there were
anything _terrestrial_ left in us at all.

So far, we have encountered none—or so the machines tell us. What we _have_
found on countless planets are billions of microbes, innumerable algae-forms,
and thousands of varieties of grasses.

Up above us here, there is a moon completely overgrown with fungus-like
structures. Unfortunately uninhabitable. Its spores make terraforming impossible
for centuries to come.

But there is one rumour that persists. The machines report that on some
missions—not a small number—technological constructs were discovered that at
least indicate another civilisation. We have even seen images. They looked
heavily decayed, but with some imagination one can still recognize the engineer
behind them. But there's no sign of the beings themselves. Perhaps others had
the same idea millions of years before us. Perhaps they even passed by mythical
Earth.
