title: The Fourth Wave and the Aliens that never came
description: >-
  Two things came together for this experience. We needed a Guinnea Pig for
  online publishing and print on demand. So we had to create a short story. and
  by accident, I had written some things about Fermi's paradox and wanted to
  proof something. The outcome was ashort storie that is also available as an
  online book. But also in here for free in EN and DE.

The Fourth Wave is our first published short story. The story evolved around a
for me intersting idea chain:

- We haven't seen any aliens yet. Why?
- Conditions are at least good for us to exist.
- How much would it take us ourselves to spread around the whole galaxy?
- Then the geometrical experiment starts: What if one human tribe can develop an
  "Arche" to go to another planet and settle every thousand years? Pessimistic
  assumption.
- That would mean that the whole galaxy could be covered with human outposts
  within 15 million years.

15 Million years is a gigantic timespan when looking into human civilisation but
it's nothing when thinking about evolutionary time spans.

So it should easily be possible for a different civilisation to achieve such a
goal and appear here on Earth. It's merely about timing.

First, I looked into the theoretical probablilities and the so called Drake
equation in this article.

After that the short story almost wrote itself:
