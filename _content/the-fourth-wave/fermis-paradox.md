  Humanity is alone in the universe. At least, that's what it looks like if you
  ignore some of the conspiracy theories. But why is that? The Fermi Paradox
  describes this phenomenon. And with the so-called Drake Equation, one gets
  closer to the probabilities.

Aliens. Extraterrestrial Lifeforms. One of the big drivers behind human space
exploration efforts and the observation of stars and galaxies is the search for
new civilisations like ours. Probably it bears the hope for the human community
to focus on a common higher goal and therefore getting distracted from killing
ourselves, probably it's the hope to find wisdom outside our planet that can
pull humanity out of the hole of self destruction.

But where to search? Where could these aliens be? Are they probably already here
on earth? Are the y probably already in contact with the powerful people, who
keep this as their biggest of all secrets? Or don't they exist at all? Can they
even exist, statistically speaking?

# The Paradox

_If they exist, then why are they not here?_

This the gist of the so called Fermi Paradox. Enrico Fermi (1901 - 1954), an
italian physicist, who formulated the paradox also delivered an answer. They're
not here, because they don't exist.

# The Drake Equation

The American scientist Frank Drake (\*1930) came up with an equation in the
1960s, that could calculate the amount of intelligent extraterrestrial worlds in
the milky way based on some external factors.

$N = R^* \times f_p \times n_e \times f_l \times f_i \times f_c \times L$

The result is the number we're searching for. N is the **possible amount of
intelligent civilisations in our galaxy**. We know one thing about this: The
number must be greater or equal one, because apparently we exist fulfilling the
criteria. The result depends on seven factors, each of them pretty much unknown.
You could only guess. So let's start a guesssing game.

$R^*$: The average **rate of star creation** in our galaxy. Drake estimated a
number of $1/y$. Conservative estimations nowadays come up with a number of
$8/y$.

$f_p$: The **planet factor**. The fraction of stars that have planets. Or
better: the likelihood of a star to have planets. In the meantime, we have
experience from good and precise observations of our nearest neighbour
starsystems. Many of these observations delivered positive results and we could
correct the number upwards. However, certain star constellations like three body
systems are known to be more unstable. Also it is known that the likelihood gets
smaller the nearer we go towards the center of our milky way, because the star
systems there have less distance between each other. Science doesn't have a
clear opinion on that part of the equation. So let's take the more pessimistic
approach of 0.2 - meaning every fifth star also has planets.

$n_e$: The amount of **planets that might support life**. That is the average
amount of planets within the habitable zone of a star system. Looking at the
solar system, there are three planets that qualify: Venus, Earth and Mars.
Additionally, many scientists think that life might also be possible on one of
the moond more outside. While the optimists say three to five, we again take a
more pessimistic approach and choose 2.

$f_l$: The **life factor**. The fraction of these habitable planets, that
actually spawns life. Also here we know that the number is above zero - just
because our Earth made it. But our technology does not yet offer the possibility
to measure oxygen or methane levels on extrasolar platents precisely. But
numbers are getting better and better. So up to now, proof of life could only be
found on earth, predecessors of that - like complex amino acids could also be
found on e.g. comets. Additionally there are experiments that simulate the
conditions of young earth with proof that such long chain proteins are forming
naturally. Therefore life is not impossible but tle likelihood is not 1 (as some
other scientists claim). A very speculative estimation of myself: $1/100$ or
0.01. Drake estimated 100% by the way.

$f_i$: The **intelligence factor**. The fraction of planets that spawn life,
that also develops intelligence and contactability, communicative life, at least
communicative enough to get detected. Well that question is highly philosophical
and not backed by any scientific fact. Actually, we'll have a problem to even
find a proper definition on what intelligence is. Terefore, let's put this
factor on the parking lot and look at it later again. This is our $x$

$f_c$: The **communication factor**. The likelihood that an intelligent
civilisation can and wants to communicate in a way that we can detect and
decypher it. Again we are in a very theoretical field - no chance to be able to
measure or proof anything. Yet the probablity might be quite high. I'm
optimistic here and claim 50% or 0.5.

$L$: The **lifespan of a technological civilisation**. Earth has reached this
evolutionary level about 100,000 years ago. Its inhabitants can be called a
"civilisation" for about 3,000 years. Human kind stood on the brink of
extinction during the cold war 50 years ago. And again at the moment an with the
climate crisis again in about 40 years. If we manage to survive this and create
the ability to spread over several planets, we step through an important pinhole
and significantly increase the probablility to survive even bigger cataclysms.
And hence survive for a significantly longer time span. So I need another very
personal estimation here and pick 10,000 years (scintist's estimations range
between 1k and 100M).

Ok then. Let's do the math by claiming - just like Fermi did - that we are the
only intelligent beings in the galaxy.

$N = R^* \times f_p \times n_e \times f_l \times f_i \times f_c \times L$

$1 = 8 \times 0,2 \times 2 \times 0,01 \times X \times 0,5 \times 10.000$

Or: $160 \times X = 1$

Or: $X = \frac{1}{160}$

So every 160th Planet that comes to life is also creating intelligent life. That
sounds pretty much to me.

Some scientists, one of them for example was Carl Sagan, have even calculated
higher numbers. Some of the optimists in the science community have come to a
result of 100 civilisations in the galaxy, some even claimed numbers of up to 4
million.

Playing with the parameters, you will see that the lifespan of a civilisation
has a major influence on the result, just because of the span of several orders
of magnitude. That's where I had guessed 10,000 years. In case a civilisation
survives its dangerous mono-planetary phase (allowing catastrophes, war and
technical failures to wipe out a whole planet), the lifespan can be much loonger
indeed.

# Explorer

This little experiment brough me to a reverse scenario. What if we conquer the
galaxy? How long would it take? And another thought experiment was born. If you
think in galactic or universal timespans, our exponential development in the
last 200 years was tremendous. Even 1000 years are nothing compared to the 13.8
billion years the universe exists. So these are the very generous parameters of
my thoughts:

- In 1,000 years latest, that is in the year 3,000, humanity will be able to
  create a **generation ship** for pioneers. Considering and not exceeding all
  current physical laws, that is without any science fiction magic, such a ship
  could reach our next star Alpha Centauri. Considering a maximum speed of 10 %
  of lightspeed, this can happen within 40 years. The inhabitants of the ship -
  thousands of people - can build a new civilisation after the arrival over
  there. The could use the resources of that other system even when they don't
  find a habitable planet.
- Another 1,000 years later, **two interstellar expeditions** could continue.
  One starting from Earth again and one starting from the surviving and thriving
  colony in the Alpha Centauri system. And conquer the next star system.
- The equation is based on **exponential growth**, but it's not base 2, because
  worlds in the center of the bubble that spreads are already surroundet by
  civilisation seeds and might not find reasonable destinations anymore. They
  would simply take too long with their journey to the next unoccupied star
  system. Assuming that the spread is mainly taking place in a spherical way,
  only a mantle of around 15 Ly is able to expand to new worlds.
- Doing some geometric calculations, I've ended up with a **spread base of
  1.0018**. Or 0,18% growth.
- The result is **15.000 iterations**. So within 15.000 iterations or 15 million
  years, the humans could occupy the whole galaxy.

Huge number, right? No. Not at all compared to galactic scales. 15 million years
ago, dinosaurs were already extinct for 50 million years. If you compress the
lifespan of the universe in one day, we'd talk about less than a minute.

We should also consider the defensive assumptions. Every iteration takes 1,000
years to achieve their goal although technology is evolving. And we, the first
iteration, might even have the needed technology by the year 2,200 rather than
3,000.

Now let's go back to the start and bring the two Experiments together again.
Let's consider the many coincidences that lead to our existence. Meteorites
bringing organic material, volcanos and their warm wells creating organic mud,
random mutations, humans inventing the wheel, electricity and computers. All of
these events accelerated the process and brought everything to a new level. But
each consecutive jump happened in smaller and spaler time spans. So one could
assume that other civilisations could be here if they existed.

_Yet, no one is here._

# Why are there no aliens on earth?

As proven, it is actually possible that we're alone in the milky way. Or in
other words that there is only one single civilisation living in our galaxy.

It is also possible, the equations show that as well, that there are other
civilisations. So what could be the reasons that we haven't seen them yet?

- **They don't exist**. Likelyhood detected. So this must be on the list.
- **There are other civilisations, but they are too far away**. If there are
  other civilisations out there, 100 lightyears might be enough to be out of
  sight. We have developed radio about 100 years ago therefore thesw waves, the
  only objectively detectable signals from earth have just traveled that far.
  Our blindspot therefore covers 99.9999 % of the milky way.
- There is a far superior civilisation that **leaves us alone by conscious
  decision**. They just don't want to interfere with our development. Probably
  they observe us and our potential and say hallo at some turning point in
  history.
- **They are here already**. They don't only watch us. They study us. They are
  directing us. Thet don't reveal themselves but they take care that we don't
  run into one of the extinction traps. They are our guardian angels or our zoo
  keepers - depending on the perspective.

## Conclusion

What would we , us, humainty, do in such a situation? For example when we detect
intelligent life on Alpha Centauri in an earlier development stage? Probably we
would also leave them alone. Very likely, we would make some experiments just
like we do with gorillas or orang utans.

If I had to place a bet, I'd choose the first option. We're alone in the milky
way. But wait. There are 12 billion galaxies out there. Well this changes the
equation a lot, doesn't it?

But if the milky way is ours, why shouldn't we dare to start conquering it? Why
don't we decouple ourselves from our home planet? Why don't we start a big
experiment that will finish 500,000 hman generations later?

Probably on some lonely planet inn some lonely star system, we finally might
even find another civilisation tha improves our understanding of everything.
