About a hundred years ago, I was invited to the hotel for the first time. But
who counts years anyway. And what are years? A relic habit from my youth on a
planet called Earth. The hotel at the end of the universe was built by Calotte.
That was eons ago, eons seem to be a better unit for time, sufficiently vague.
The Vergency Hotel exists outside of physics, that's the only way I can describe
it.

You can't visit it through physical means like traveling. You simply appear.

You can't learn anything about this place. You just know. Of course, only if you
know it.

Maybe I'll remember how I first came here. At some point in my first life as a
regular human, as I call it, I think I managed to completely focus my thoughts.
Thoughts are the material of which the universe is made. No surprise, that the
best way to travel is through thoughts.

The first time, I had help. Eugene, my former tutor, brought me to the higher
level. To the place where all dimensions converge like rays of light through a
lens. Now that I'm writing it down, I recognize the contradiction. So I must
have learned something after all.

Today, I myself am assigned as a tutor for the fourth time. I volunteered again.
Everyone does this here from time to time. It's the best source for new thoughts
and new perspectives.
