Udin found a stone. At first, it was fully covered with dirt. She only saw its
beauty and quality because a small corner stood out. So she went to the river
and cleaned it up. It was the most beautiful piece, she had ever seen. It had a
perfect form. Except for a light blue shine, it was transparent and it had
engravings on each side.

She gave it to her father Kules, who was the leader of their tribe. The artefact
was so extraordinary and mysterious, it had to come from the gods themselves. So
the tribe started to worship the stone. The women cpoied the stone ornaments for
their own jewellery and made amulets that were supposed to protect their warrior
husbands from large animals and rival tribes.

The stone itself, however, remained for generations in the possession of the
tribe leader and nourished their power through its cult.

With power came envy. A century later, a riot started and the tribe became
extinct in fight for the stone. The artefact got lost again.

Oscar van Dyk was one of the experts in the team of Carla Ruiz. They were
responsible for the artefacts they called octahedra based on their form. There
were four parts, almost identical and slightly imperfect. They were almost
transparent except for a slight shimmer in different wavelengths.

Sometimes Oscar leaves his labs to visit lectures on campus. Today, it was about
Giovanni Battista Belzoni, an archaeologist, who discovered the entrance to the
Chephren pyramid in Gizeh.

Oscar almost fell from his chair as he listened to the monotonous listing of the
pyramid's parameters. Tilt angle 53.16°, said the professor. That was the same
value as in the octahedra. A perfect octahedron should have 54.73°. And if you
put two pyramids together, you get an octahedron.

Oscar jumped off his seat. The whole auditorium looked at him. He ran out and
straight back to the team's institute.

"Chephren", he shouted into the room. "The Chephren pyramid, that's where we
find the next piece."
