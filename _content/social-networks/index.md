description: >-
  I'm currently working on a bunch of product and technology ideas and dive into
  the topic of federated social networks and networking in general. Here's some
  of the outcome.

I've been working for XING for over ten years. XING has been a professional
social network and direct competitor to Linked In and has even been the market
leader in German speaking countries.

However, centralised social networks have certain dynamics and XING's star was
sinking and it has turned away from the social part. I still think that some of
its features had been interesting and I am still interested in some of the
mechanchanics of social networks.

Also I - just like probably everyone else - have been using all of them.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok. Later Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads and so
on. And I was especially fascinated from federated and decentral networks and
from the "bllionare exit".

At first I searched for a new home of my favourite images -previously posted in
Instagram. THe first article looks into the federated alternatives and their
capabilities:

Then, I guess it was during a meetuo organised through
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE), some of us had the idea to build
that on our own. Fully open source and federated.

I immediately dived into the architecture and the protocols they are using. So
here's my summary on this.

```

And finally, I created the pith for the new social network / groups platform /
meetup site we will be working on in the future. It still has it's temporary
name "meetdown", but I'm sure I can update this very soon.
