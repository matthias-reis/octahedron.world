Science fiction stories with aliens must find a way to pass through space. The
distance between planets is overwhelmingly large. There are only three
possibilities to conquer that void.

**Time**: we merely have 100 years per life and therefore we can't reach much
further than 10 Ly. We can only extend that radius by involving more than one
human generation. That would be the only solution that conforms to #hardscifi
criteria.

**Speed**: Using scifi tricks, we could break through the barrier of light speed
and thus shorten the journeys. However, these tricks demand some thinking. You
don't want to have Einstein's laws in the way.

**Manipulation**: Even more sophisticated tricks allow us to bend space as we
want to and thus bring those far away worlds nearer to us.

Simply speaking there are space odysseys with or without tricks. The type of the
resulting stories is fundamentally different though.
