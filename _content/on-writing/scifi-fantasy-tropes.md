Hello there! New topic coming in. In the past, I have shared my worldbuilding
and the stories that spun off. But now I also would like to dive a bit deeper
into the commonalities in Science Fiction and Fantasy literature - and sometimes
literature in general.

There are two dimensions to cover, typical characters or archetypes as well as
typical storylines that repeat over and over again in different shades. These
are called tropes. And as all aspects of speculative fiction are our playground,
there's much to find out.

We go from magicians over orcs to aliens, from war to love, from adventure to
family and from utopia to dystopia.

As I'm writing this, I can tell you that I'm most curious about those findings
myself and - to be honest - I have no idea yet how to approach it. But I'm very
much looking forward to the process and invite you to the journey.
