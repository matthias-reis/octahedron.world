"Weird Things" sounded like a good umbrella for all those oddities for a while.
If a topic didn't fit into anything else, put it here.

But then again, the current collection has a certain shared vibe, a theme that
repeats itself. A glimpse of the unconscious.

So here's the collection now. Perfect to dive into my mind for a while. Enjoy!
