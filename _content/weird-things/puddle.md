It was pouring rain all day. Actually since last week. Actually, I might have
forgotten what the sun looks like. I was walking along the pavement near my
flat. The big city vibe is more purest when it's dark and everything is wet. The
neon lights, that are everywhere are kaleidoscoping themselves in reflections
from every single puddle on the pavement. Even though quite some people are on
the streets, everyone feels isolated and alone, covered deeply in their coat or
shielded by a hostile umbrella.

There are also these other types of puddles. Those with the right angle. They
don't reflect any light. They are pitch black. Black Holes. Sagittarius A\*. I
always get drawn to them. I can't help it. It's like they are calling me.
Usually when I arrive the angle changes and they reflect the world again.

Everything during such a walk is subconscious. It's as expected. But today was
different. My subconscious self was again drawn from black hole to black hole.
And one of them didn't change their mode of reflection. It kept its deepest
black. At first I—my aware self I mean—didn't see it. It was just like an
ephemeral fog. I took a second look. I stepped closer, leaned down. Still no
lights.

Then I stepped into the puddle, it couldn't be more than a centimeter deep. I
have no idea why I did it. Probably to see if it was real. My shoe was halfway
in and I still didn't feel the ground. I wanted to pull it out. But its gravity
was stronger. Now I was pulled over to the other side. Downwards. But I didn't
fall. It still felt like walking on solid ground. On the other side I could jus
walk on. I wasn't even wet.

But the world had changed. It was darker, but also warmer. The rain was the same
but the neon lights were different. The letters and the design looked like
Korean or Japanese. I don't know. Where was I? At the other end of the world? At
a different time? A parallel universe?

I walked on driven by curiosity. But while walking I didn't notice that I
stepped into the next puddle. everything turned 180 degreees once more and I was
back standing next to the black hole in my own world. The only difference was
that it started mirroring the neon lights again. Physics as it should be.

It was just a dream I said and then I walked on. Suddenly I noticed that my shoe
was wet, soaked in water that didn't show any reflection. I shook off the
waterdrops, shrugged and then walked home.
