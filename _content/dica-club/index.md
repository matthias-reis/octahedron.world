Nothing to see here yet, sorry. That was a fake door test. Congratulations, you
passed.

No, jokes aside. Some time ago I started experimenting with some more active
formats and even wanted to create an own domain dica.club for it. Dica is latin
for "clue" or "hint".

Now we're here. I need to do some more adaptations and the first experimental
escape riddle game will be available.

Just some patience, please.
