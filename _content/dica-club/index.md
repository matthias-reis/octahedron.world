DICA is the Portuguese word for "hint" or "clue". A while ago, I had an idea to
build a platform for escape games, scavenger hunts and pub quizzes. It was
called DICA Club.

I didn't have time to implement it back then, but the architecture and the first
example quests are now available.

Here you can try it.

It's also available in german.

Additionally, I have recently added quite some features to that workflow. So you
should have a complete quest game experience now.
