My wife Anne had the idea sketched out a year or two ago. So this category is a
collection of sketches around a new short story.

A cat is in the center of the story. An old and wise one, we're talking about
street wisdom. Persian breed, of course. And this cat is a private investigator.
Solves cases in his hood.

For now, I don't want to say more. I'm still in the process of developing the
plot and mood of it. But feel free to dive into the textual sketches during the
following weeks and months.
