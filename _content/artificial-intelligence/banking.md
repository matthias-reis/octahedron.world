Another one from the series of jobs that might or might not exist in ten years
anymore. This time: banking. The whole financial system is extremely mood
driven. So why not optimise it away?

Banks are inventing money. They are private companies that act in the public
interest. The scandals and market crashes in the past years have shown that a
bit more regulation doesn't seem to be enough. Additionally, the capital for
companies totally depends on mood. Some days ago, a fake account posted that
Insulin is for free resulting in the near bankruptcy of the producing company.

Cryptocurrencies to the rescue? I don't know. They operate in the same
mood-driven markets and the "crypto" in that name eats up a lot of energy in
useless calculations.

But something has to happen and some Bitcoin design principles are not that bad.
Therefore my prediction: As soon as somebody invents the right twist, the
banking sector will drastically change.
