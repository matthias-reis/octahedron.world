I initially had planned a different topic today, but **Chat GPT** is so amazing
that I have to talk about it in the context of AI Jobs. Remember Covid? I'm sure
every one of us learned exponential growth by example at that time -
harmless-looking things growing into big waves within days. The same is
happening with AI at the moment.

Many of us still see the crappy Alexa and Siri interface and failing image
recognition. But all of that technology is growing exponentially. Slower than a
Covid wave, but steady.

And there are also breakthroughs like Dall-E or ChatGPT that show their power
already. Who can they replace? Well, it seems that Chat GPT can code better than
Github Copilot. So goodbye Stack Overflow. But it also writes other kinds of
text. So as we're on it, probably goodbye Google, too. And to the copywriters
out there: Write more unique content, or you will be replaced soon.
