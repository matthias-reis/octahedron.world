  But the things you have to build with your bare hands should be safe, right?

Another candidate for Jobs that will be gone in twenty years or at least look
different is the construction worker, the craftsman who works with concrete,
steel and wood.

Today, we only see a vague glimpse of what will change. There are the first
larger-scale 3D printers for building materials and scientists have just
invented 3D printing with wood. So, there are still hundreds of tasks that need
to be done by hand.

But the speed and precision will increase yearly and the price of the machines
will one day be lower than the price of labour. There will be the usual period
of exploitation. If we look thoroughly, we can see this already now in that
labour market, especially on big construction sites with high time pressure.

After that, I assume only the artists among the craftsmen will find work. And
the growing versatility of the machines, that create more interesting organic or
baroque buildings, will combine with some oases of true craftsmanship. Probably
by the year 2050.
