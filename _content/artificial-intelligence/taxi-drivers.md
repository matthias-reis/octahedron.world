Autonomous driving is a huge topic. Especially in Germany, where the car is the
holy grail of freedom, it's being discussed a lot. Many people own a car. A lot
of them only because there is no other infrastructure to use, e.g. in the
countryside. But what if there was?

Autonomous driving could be an answer because human drivers actually don't scale
as well as vehicles. And the traditionally inflexible concepts of public
transport will be revised with more intelligent approaches. There are a lot of
working concepts where intelligent algorithms create synergies.

A change in that sector towards automation is not only the next technical
evolution but a necessity if we want to reach our sustainability goals.

There are around 250.000 taxi drivers in Germany. Adding 100.000 bus drivers and
35.000 rail vehicle drivers. The number of customers will grow, while (my
prediction) none of these jobs will be left in twenty years.
