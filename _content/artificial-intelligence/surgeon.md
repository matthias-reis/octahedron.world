  A job that relies on precision? That's worth a look from machine's
  perspective.

Some weeks ago, I wrote an article about doctors and AI as their major job
market competitors. Family Physicians mostly do one thing: diagnosing or finding
the correct disease based on given symptoms. Surgeons are doctors as well but
they do completely different tasks, they do high-precision physical work.

Although this is the other end of the possible spectrum of work, also here AI
and robots will take over. A machine can be infinitely more precise than a
living hand. Its sensors (light, infrared, distance, etc.) can be better in
orders of magnitude. Its stamina is outpacing even a large team of surgeons.

The future lies in surgeries done by machines and supervised by humans. Machines
can take over the whole spectrum of human health. They already surveil us
permanently through smart watches, detect cancer earlier and most of the
described measures are already under research.

Doctors won't disappear. But just like many other Jobs, their work will look
different in the future.
