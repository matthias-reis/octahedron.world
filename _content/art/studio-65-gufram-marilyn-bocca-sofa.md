title: 'Marilyn Bocca Sofa'
description: >-
  The legendary lip-shaped sofa designed in 1970 by the Italian collective 
  Studio 65 (under Franco Audrito). Inspired by Salvador Dalí’s 1935 surrealist 
  portrait of Mae West, this postmodern iteration pays tribute to the 
  sultry pout of Marilyn Monroe. Manufactured by Gufram using cold-expanded 
  polyurethane foam and a red elastic fabric cover, the "Bocca" (Italian 
  for "mouth") became a manifesto of the Radical Design movement, 
  challenging the functionalist constraints of traditional 20th-century 
  furniture with irony, sensuality, and vibrant Pop aesthetics.
