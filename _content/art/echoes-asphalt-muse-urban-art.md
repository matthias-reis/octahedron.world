title: Echoes of the Asphalt Muse
description: >-
  A gritty yet poetic slice of urban life where street art meets daily utility. 
  The wheat-pasted guitarist and silhouette figures on weathered wooden shutters
  create a silent, rock-and-roll stage for a stationary cargo bike, blending 
  French culinary slogans with the raw texture of a sun-drenched alleyway.
