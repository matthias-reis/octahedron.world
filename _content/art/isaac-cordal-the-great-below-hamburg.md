title: 'The Great Below'
description: >-
  A poignant and unsettling sculpture by Isaac Cordal, likely from his 
  series "The Great Below." The piece depicts a weary, cyborg-like figure 
  in a state of social exclusion, sitting on a ragged blanket with a 
  meager coin bowl. The contrast between the figure's mechanical, 
  high-tech limbs and its vulnerable, human-like face serves as a biting 
  critique of the dehumanizing effects of late capitalism and the 
  precarious nature of existence in a technologically obsessed world.
