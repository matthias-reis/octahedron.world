title: 'Tête sur tige (Head on a Rod)'
description: >-
  A group of Alberto Giacometti’s raw, diminutive plaster heads mounted on
  slender 
  metal rods. Created around 1947, these "partial figures" emerged from the
  artist's 
  terrifying revelation regarding the thin line between life and death. The 
  highly textured, knife-worked surfaces and the isolation of the heads in
  space 
  serve as an existential exploration of the human gaze and the fragile nature 
  of individual identity.
