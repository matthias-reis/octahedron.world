title: 'White and Yellow'
description: >-
  A striking relief-collage by the British constructivist Marlow Moss. 
  Created in 1935, this work is a masterpiece of Neoplasticism that 
  incorporates oil paint, string, and layered canvas. Moss used 
  metallic-like string to create a rhythmic, three-dimensional grid, 
  avoiding the use of black to better capture pure light. The single 
  yellow rectangle in the lower-left serves as a precise, mathematical 
  counterpoint to the heavily textured, white T-shaped overlay.
