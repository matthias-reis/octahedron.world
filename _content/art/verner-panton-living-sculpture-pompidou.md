ttitle: 'Siège Living Sculpture'
description: >-
  An immersive "Pop" furniture environment by Danish designer Verner Panton. 
  Originally conceived for his private residence and later showcased at the 
  1972 Cologne Furniture Fair, this organic, cave-like structure encourages 
  sensory exploration. Its vibrant, polychrome foam and wool elements are 
  designed to absorb sound and provide a space for relaxation and 
  unconstrained social interaction within the Centre Pompidou collection.
