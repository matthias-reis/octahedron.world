title: 'Home Sweet Home'
description: >-
  A seminal work from Banksy's "Vandalised Oils" series, created for his 
  2006 "Barely Legal" exhibition in Los Angeles. The piece features an 
  appropriated, idyllic 19th-century-style landscape painting—complete 
  with a "chocolate box" cottage and stone bridge—which has been 
  disrupted by the artist's hand-painted, dripping white graffiti. The 
  contrast between the nostalgic, bourgeois imagery of domestic security 
  and the raw visual language of vandalism serves as a sharp critique 
  of social inequality and the environmental "engineering of hostile 
  environments."
