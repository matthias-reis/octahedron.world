title: 'Untitled (to Saura and Brian)'
description: >-
  A mesmerizing fluorescent light installation by Dan Flavin, typically 
  exhibited in major contemporary art institutions like the Centre Pompidou. 
  The piece utilizes a geometric arrangement of yellow and blue light tubes 
  to transform the gallery space, creating a glowing trapezoidal portal that 
  blurs the line between physical sculpture and pure radiant energy.
