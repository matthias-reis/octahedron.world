title: 'Auf Spitzen (On Points)'
description: >-
  A masterful oil painting by Wassily Kandinsky, created in 1928 during his 
  influential Bauhaus period. The composition is a complex dialogue of 
  geometric precision and lyrical abstraction, featuring delicate lines 
  intersecting vibrant circles and triangles. The work explores the 
  spiritual tension between form and color, anchored by a rhythmic 
  structure that reflects Kandinsky's fascination with the synesthetic 
  relationship between art and music.
