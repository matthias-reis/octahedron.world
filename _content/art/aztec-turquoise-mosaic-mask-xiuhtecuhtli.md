title: The Turquoise Lord of the Sun
description: >-
  A breathtaking Aztec turquoise mosaic mask, likely representing the fire 
  god Xiuhtecuhtli (the "Turquoise Lord") or the sun god Tonatiuh. 
  Crafted between 1400 and 1521, this ritual object features a carved 
  cedar wood base encrusted with hundreds of tiny turquoise tesserae. 
  The eyes are fashioned from mother-of-pearl, while the teeth are 
  made of conch shell. The raised nodules or "warts" on the face are 
  thought to reference the legend of the god Nanahuatzin, who sacrificed 
  himself in fire to become the fifth sun.
