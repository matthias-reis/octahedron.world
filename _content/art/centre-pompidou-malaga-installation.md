title: Juan Muñoz - Centre Pompidou Málaga
description: >-
  These puppet-like sculptures by Spanish artist Juan Muñoz create a haunting,
  theatrical atmosphere in the gallery space. The uniform chairs and the
  elongated faces add an air of eerie uniformity, inviting viewers to ponder
  themes of identity and collective experience.
