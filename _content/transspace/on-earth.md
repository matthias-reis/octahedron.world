At the time the Kret were discovered, they became the main topic in the media
streams on Earth for six months in a row. No other topic came through. The
intrigues and complications surrounding the big corporations or the futile
efforts of the states to regain control were forgotten.

"The Council" took over. That's what the news providers called it. An expert
panel composed of top people from the Gemini Project, Zodiac and other
corporations, as well as some chief diplomats and on top of that, the stars of
the show, five experts.

The experts were perfectly and skillfully chosen. Eloquent, wise, visionary, and
above all, "likeable". They had the potential to become media heroes (mainly
because they were also media experts). They could explain all the complex
processes in a simple way, not so much the technical ones, but especially the
sociological issues and implications.
