  An author needs a go-to world for spacefaring stories. Here's mine. It
  includes a way to overcome the speed limit of light. And it also includes the
  first drafts of an alien or almost alien race.

The great gig in the sky.

That might be the best tagline for this world. Since I was a teenager, I worked
on it. Recently I found all my records and notes from that time again. Copies of
long lists of stars from a time where we still thought that planets are rare in
the universe. Hand drawn schema diagrams of energy flows within a space ship or
the ranking hierarchy of the fleet. Some of the material was very raw and very
obviously copied from the SciFi of that time.

But the general dilemma was tackled. If you want to visit other stars you have
to invent something that overcomes the universal speed limit. So I invented
transspace, the great unifying theory of my space opera world.

# The Transspace Theory

Have a look at this world building exercise first:

```yaml teaser
slug: transspace-worldbuilding
```

As always, the world creates ideas, not the other way around. So I will surely
dive into one or the other.

slugs:
  - intro-transspace-tales
  - van-der-belt

# The Kret, my Favourite Aliens

However most of the stories evolve around aliens. When a society has the ability
to travel easily to other planets, there has to be a motivation beyond pure
resources and exploitation.

The Kret were my number one aliens, living 30 Ly away. So let's look into their
worldbuilding first:

slug: kret
```

Now stories combine and we bring both together to form the human sphere of
influence in the 22nd and 23rd century.

```yaml group
slugs:
  - on-earth
  - power
  - introducing-the-spins
```

Now to the grand finale. The short story, that unveils many details about the
relation between the two races, the inventions surrounding transspace and all
their connections.
