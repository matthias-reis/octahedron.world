In all the states in the world, the individual person is at the centre of all
rules and ethics. That includes dictatorships. The only difference here is that
not all people have equal rights.

Only China lately drifted in another direction. There it seems that the society
is everything. This also means that certain people can suffer, but the whole
community thrives. Projects of huge dimensions are easy to pull off and so the
individual wealth is rising as well.

Such a system is superior to any ethical system that is based on individuality.
Only capitalism, the most extreme form of liberal individualism can offer almost
the same speed of development as such a structure. However, capitalism being a
more accidental and chaotic system allows more innovation and tipping points
towards progress like the steam engine or the computer.

The fact that China is about to overtake the West in wealth and growth shows the
power of that system. But how much do they need us?
