  A second earth? No, we don't need that, right? We can still save ours. But do
  we? Are we on the right track with the climate catastrophy, biodiversity,
  fascism and other threats? Here's some real world facts and figures.

Even if one day, we need one, there is no second earth, no world 2. We have only
one planet, and we are destroying it on many levels. Destruction in our case
means using more resources than the planet has to offer. It also means
destroying bidiversity and interfering with natural healing and balancing
processes. But it also means creating social unrest, fascism and wars.

This chapter therefore is political and opinionated. But I try to add facts and
sources to as many statements as possible.

# Climate Crisis

I hope I don't have to discuss with my readers that the human made climate
change is real. If we're clear on that, you can start diving into some detailed
essays in a - let's call it - trilogy.

Part one also introduces a way how you can have a better idea on what "consumes
x toms of CO2" means. Even for me as someone who likes numbers and data, this
was very helpful. It also covers many interesting facts on the topic of global
energy consumptions

==> world-2-energy

A second column of CO2 emissions comes from the transport sector. I also looked
into that in more detail.

==> world-2-traffic

And the third column is agriculture, food and our diet. We often tend to forget
that when talking about the climate crisis. So here are those details.

==> world-2-vegan

I've also found some more text circling around that topic over and over again
and I'm sure I will return to it in the future.

# Politics

At the moment (writing this in the beginning of 2026), I do not have any higher
hopes into our political systems. Yes, it's plural, because not only our own
country affects our wealth and health.

Democracies are under pressure while authoritarian leaders and right wing
ideaologies are on the rise in many countries. Everyone is following the craze
around Donald Trump and his daily changing disruptive "ideas".

As a result from time to time I want to dive deeper into the mechanics behins
those movements and what you could do agains it. So if you're interested, here's
a current list.
