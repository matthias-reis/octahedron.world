A new series, folks. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows and I read a lot of
books. So I'd like to do some reviews here. Not so much in the direction of good
and bad and "x out of ten" voting, but rather under the aspect of what parts are
interesting or unique in the sci-fi and fantasy world.

But of course, I'd directly like to dive into the topic with a concrete example.
Ursula K. Leguin, The Dispossessed. I finished this book from 1974 some weeks
ago as it is on almost every sci-fi must-read list I know. Before that, I knew
LeGuin only from her fantasy work "Earthsea".

The book includes incredibly fascinating speculative fiction that is not
dominated by tech topics as usual. Instead, it focuses on social aspects. If you
ever wanted to know what Anarchism in its pure form really means and how it is
related to communism and capitalism, this book might be more helpful than any
piece of theoretical work.

It was eye-opening to me in that regard.
