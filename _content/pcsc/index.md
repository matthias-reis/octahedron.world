  PCSC is the chapter that contains real time data from my music collection and
  a contest for a small group of people to vote for songs. It's a very personal
  project.

This area still takes a while. Construction signs are up.

But the actual content is already there. So what will await you?

**PCSC Contest:** Part one will be a literal interactive song contest (the
Perfect Circle Son Contest). Four Videos, five points to give. You can vote for
your favorite song. As soon as enough have voted, we bring on the next.

**PCSC One:** Part two is really an internal thing (but the marketing name rocks
already, I think :-) ). I rate songs, albums, artists for years now and
everything is collected in a database. Whe I want to know mu own favourite song
of let's say 2015, I can look it up. Since I don't have any secrets, I will make
it available publicly. It just needs a bit more "vibe" coding.
