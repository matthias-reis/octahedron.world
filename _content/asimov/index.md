description: >-
  My first story for children. The only staring info was that it should be
  something with a robot. I mixed in a bit of the back story from the TV series
  of ALF and that was the birth of Asimov.

Asimov was the first children's character I created. It is based on a Lego robot
set and then evolved around the idea that a boy from earth can talk to him.

For now there's just this first story, but I'm sure this world has more than one
to offer.

As it was for my little nephew, I also have it in german.
