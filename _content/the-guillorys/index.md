This series for children is still at a very early stage. There's only one story
and it's also still in the making, not even half finished.

But what's the idea? I wanted to do something with superheroes. So I started
inventing a family of superhero mice. I grew up with this topic. Looking at you
Tom & Jerry or Speedy Gonzales.

The setting is an old american mansion with a southern flair and the aura of New
Orleans. As usual for mice, the family is huge and has built an extensive
infrastructure inside the house including a tequila bar in the rooftop.

But the twist is that every family member adopts a special power during their
childhood.
