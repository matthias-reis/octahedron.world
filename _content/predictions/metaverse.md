As a big cyberpunk fan, I am constantly interested in the VR topic. The
Metaverse is the latest real-world iteration on this topic and the Apple VR
initiative will surely give it another spin and acceleration. So what will
Meta's approach most likely look like in ten years?

Let's go back to a valid analogy first. The internet is so successful because it
defines an open standard everyone can implement against. Very similar things are
happening on social networks with the Activity Pub and other open protocols. And
Meta is starting an initiative to go in that direction, too.

VR and AR are development- and design-heavy environments. It's web design with a
third dimension and therefore, it demands a heavy investment to put useful,
consumable information into that medium. I doubt that many players will throw
their money into a closed environment like the metaverse.

So I see two possible outcomes:

- The idea will open up and allow decentralised multi-platform compatible
  solutions. In this scenario, I see many experiments running in ten years,
  probably a first consolidation phase towards a stable open system that could
  replace the classic internet experience.
- The system stays closed and is maintained by Facebook alone. Then we'll have a
  thriving space for some years and a gold rush of marketeers until the interest
  will be in decline. Competing platforms will follow up just to decline a bit
  later. In ten years, that new thing will not be dead yet, but you'd smell it
  already just like you do with Facebook at the moment.

Please also read the [augmented reality](/augmented-reality) prediction. The two
are closely connected.

For the metaverse, I can say: They have messed it up big time. Especially Mark
Zuckerberg himself. The metaverse is not a thing. So if nobody comes up with a
reboot of the whole concept, it will die a slow death and never make it in th
history book of big inventions.
