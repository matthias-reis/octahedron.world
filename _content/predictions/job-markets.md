As long as we can think, work has been at the centre of our existence. These
days, it covers around 25% of our adult life, 40 hours a week. In former times,
it was more and it tends to become less in the next decades. Two megatrends pull
on each side of this important part of our life, on the job market place.

On the one hand, automation and AI take more and more jobs away and replace them
with machines. I have dedicated a whole series to that already. On the other
hand, the generation of baby boomers (age group 1946 - 1964) will retire by 2030
latest when the last working boomers will be 66 years old. Thus much more people
will leave the job market than join. Within the next eight years, we talk about
a loss of about 4 million people. Looking at the birth rates, the trend will
continue afterwards for at least five more years in similarly dramatic numbers.

So here's my prediction: Germany has a tech focus with many engineers and
mechanics. Especially in these areas, AI will be strong in the future and we
will see a saturation of the market combined with an increase of productivity.
In many other areas like education, health care and craftsmanship, we will see a
massive shortage of labour that will threaten our society if we don't allow
people from abroad to fill the gaps through migration.

We now see a first wave of disruption through AI on the one hand. And a shortage
of workforce starting with jobs you can't do anymore when you're over 60 (like
craftsmen).So the prediction holds true.
