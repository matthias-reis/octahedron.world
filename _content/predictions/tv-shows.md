Everyone writes about the rapid progress of AI. Everyone makes experiments with
it, everyone has tried it out already. It's working much too well, right? Yes,
it makes mistakes, but it's improving faster than you could write articles about
its flaws.

And the next generation will be built into our everyday tools and thus replace
the experts you always asked about these pivot tables. It creates perfect
PowerPoints, charts and code.

It can generate images, moving images, voices, plots and stories etc. My
prediction for 2033: You can prompt some lines to your AI and it will spit out
your own TV show in high quality, 3D if you like. 1,000-liners like my posts
here will be enough to bring this to life. If you don't like the main character,
talk to the AI and a minute later, it will be replaced by a more suitable
personality.

And although everybody can produce, the best ones will still run in front of a
bigger audience. But they better be really good!

## Annotation 2026

AI is still in the phase of exponential growth. We see first glimpses of this
prediction already. People create deep fake videos within seconds. You can't
trust images on social media anymore. And people who can't anticipate if
something is fake are lost and easily manipulated.

So there's only a small step to fictional videos and bespoke TV shows. I'd even
say those are the most harmless outcome of the AI tech boom we see at the
moment.

I should make a prediction on AGI next, right?
