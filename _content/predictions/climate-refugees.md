Everything can already be seen in the architectural foundation of future
history. It's getting hot on Earth. Some regions will become inhabitable. People
who are currently living there will fight for their survival.

It will be like in a closed room with only one ventilation slot. Those who are
near the slot will have a bit of air. But those far away in the other corner
suffocate. The World Bank says, 143 Million people will be affected in the
year 2030. That is 143 Million refugees, 86 Million alone in Africa. This is a
wave of refugees, that is thirty times larger than the Syrian wave.

They will stream towards Europe. Along the way they will create social heat like
electricity running through a light bulb. There will be civil wars about water,
food and shadow, the most basic and essential things.

Finally, I should repeat that I'm not talking about ficton. This is not a
potential scenario if we don't reache the Paris climate goals in 2050. It's a
2030 and 2040 topic.

I'm sure you know the situation when water is boiling in a closed pot. I think
we are at that point already. But we still don't want to lift the lid.

The climate crisis is accelerating. Its effects are visible permanently and
everywhere. But the humans found a way to discract themselves from it-with wars
on other parts of the world.

This topic will hit us. It will hit us harder than we expect, because we don't
use the time to prepare.
