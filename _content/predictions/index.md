  Starting in 2023, I created a set of predictions about technology, society,
  and the future as a whole. What will the world look like in 2033, ten yeaars
  later? Will be continuously updated with addons.

Here's my predictions section. I do most of them for myself. I want to check
over time, if I'm right.

Therefore the following documents are living. They are being annotated over and
over again to see if the original prediction is still true or worth a thought or
at least relevant.

All predictions will mention a target year in their title. The first batch has
originally been created in 2023 with a horizon of ten years, so 2033. I think in
2026, it's time to give them a fist re-visit and leave some notes.
