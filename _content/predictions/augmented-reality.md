Hello and happy 2023! I thought I'd start the new year with a new storyline of
predictions. Now in ten years. This is just for myself. I'd like to look back at
them in 2033 and laugh about how ridiculous they were. Let's start with
Augmented Reality.

Every large tech corporation is working on it. FAcebooks metaverse somehow deals
with it. Apple is working on hardware that is supposed to replace the iPhone and
the main device. But there's no real killer application out there yet.

Anyhow, ten years from now, this will be the single most important communication
method. People will walk around with glasses that look just like glasses. But
they show them all information in context. From navigation over search in a
supermarket to profile information. Everything that is done on the phone now,
will be done in AR in ten years.

Millions of eyeglass designs, further improvements and the first lenses will
continuously improve that technology wave.
