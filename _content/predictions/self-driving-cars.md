Traffic is terrible, jams are annoying, Construction sites are from hell and I
don't even want to start with the other drivers. I've made a
[full storyline](/storylines/traffic) out of it. If only cars could drive on
their own. Let's look at the situation in ten years.

Right now, we already have working systems of self-driving cars. Complex AI is
making more objective and a hundred times faster decisions. And it's just the
beginning, the advent of AI. Things are improving daily and these systems - if
used by the masses - could increase their learning dataset by many orders of
magnitude as soon as the cars get on the streets.

My prediction for 2033: We will have the technical break-even. These driving
robots will be more reliable, more energy-efficient and less involved in
accidents than human drivers. But especially in Germany, I can see many
opponents that want to keep their freedom. So in ten years, this will not yet be
the standard. Probably in 15, though. We'll see.

It's a solid prediction. We will get to this level of technology. But our
society has to do small steps to accept it. We see a similar phenomenon with
electric cars at the moment. Clearly superior technology, but many people don't
want to switch because of irrational reasons.

Probably we especially in Germany should take the opportunity to take two steps
at a time and not only catch up with the ev technology but also lead in
autonomous driving. Probably the option of the freedom to drive yourself is
enough.
